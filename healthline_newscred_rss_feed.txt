His face was bloodied from the fall and he wasn’t responsive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Someone said, ‘His chest isn’t moving,’ so I started chest compressions immediately because I knew it was important to do it right away,” Gordon said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After getting about a dozen compressions in, another racer took over. Three bystanders – two of whom were race participants and all medical professionals – alternated giving CPR.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A police officer quickly arrived with an automated external defibrillator, or AED, a portable device that can shock the heart back to a normal rhythm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hughes was in an ambulance on his way to the hospital within about 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testing at the hospital revealed Hughes needed a triple bypass, which he had a few days later. After the surgery, he began cardiac rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fifty days after his cardiac arrest, he was strong enough to return to the race course and complete the second half.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He crossed the finish line with his family and some of his rescuers. He called the experience “humbling.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s overwhelming to think about how many people helped save me and all the support I’ve gotten,” said Hughes, a retired Army officer who works at the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Warning signs ignored&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even before his cardiac arrest, Hughes was working with a cardiologist to manage his risks for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hughes, 61, had high blood pressure and managed it for more than a decade with medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also had a family history of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His grandfather had a stroke in his 60s and died two years later. His father had two heart attacks, one of which occurred in his 30s. Then his brother suffered a fatal heart at age 54.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This really opened my eyes to the importance of your family history,” Hughes said. “I had all those warning signs from my family, but I didn’t really take them seriously.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hughes has overhauled his diet to add more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats. He &amp;nbsp;has also sharply reduced fatty foods and salt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hughes has urged his two daughters and two sons to talk with their doctors about their risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also shared his experience with 300 co-workers at a health-focused “town hall” at the Pentagon. He encouraged them to check with their doctors about their risks and learn what they can about their family health history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Importance of CPR training&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experience also gave Hughes a greater appreciation for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/UCM_473161_CPR-and-ECC.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CPR training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He underwent training last July.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each year in the United States, more than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside a hospital. Only about 11 percent of those treated by emergency medical services survive, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://cpr.heart.org/AHAECC/CPRAndECC/AboutCPRFirstAid/CPRFactsAndStats/UCM_475748_CPR-Facts-and-Stats.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt; from the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CPR can double or triple a person’s chance of survival, especially if performed within the first few minutes of cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gordon, 32, is a teacher and underwent CPR training a few years ago as a workplace requirement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I always figured someone else would be around that was better prepared,” she said. “The fact that I was able to use it on my dad really made the importance of knowing CPR more real.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gordon has become a strong advocate for CPR training, sharing her story on social media and with her coworkers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve heard from so many people that said they got certified after hearing our story,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hughes has been exercising regularly, logging at least 11,500 steps every day. He’s careful to listen to his body and take things at a slower pace so he doesn’t get overtired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On April 1, he returned to the Monument 10K. Although initially apprehensive, he completed the race in 81 minutes, mixing walking and jogging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He raced alongside Gordon, as well as his other daughter, Emily Clayton, and son-in-law, Brandon Clayton.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was tired, but didn’t overdo it,” he said, adding that in the past he would have pushed himself to jog the entire race. “The race could not have been better.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/runner-crosses-finish-line-50-days-after-heart-stops-during-race/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;original story&lt;/a&gt; was published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Heart Association News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
lt;p&gt;Caring for someone with dementia often goes on for years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First the person you love has trouble remembering simple words. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, she puts her phone in the refrigerator. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before you turn around, she wanders out the door into the street and can’t find her way home. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It isn’t easy to know what to do, even for nurses and doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Family members usually learn as they go along. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But expert advice can make the lives of caregivers and their loved ones easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Attending a free one-day “boot camp” for caregivers, organized by the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), made all the difference to Hugo Schmidt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schmidt, a retired middle school teacher in Los Angeles, has been caring for his 72-year-old wife, Alice, since 2012.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some time, Alice has been using a walker. When they were outdoors, Schmidt held her arm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the UCLA education program, he learned that she could pull him off balance or he could twist her arm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, he learned to support her by holding the back of her pants or a belt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I asked her if it made her feel secure and she said it was better,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A growing need for education&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2587084&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; percent of Americans age 65 and over suffer from dementia, when loss of memory and reasoning abilities interfere with daily life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They may live as long as 26 years with the condition, needing personal care. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They might have &lt;a href=&quot;/health/alzheimers-disease/life-expectancy&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, caused by a buildup of plaques in the brain, or &lt;a href=&quot;/health/dementia/vascular-dementia&quot;&gt;vascular dementia&lt;/a&gt;, which comes after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alz.org/documents_custom/facts-and-figures-2017-news-release.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15 million&lt;/a&gt; Americans are caring for loved ones with dementia. A third say that this responsibility has hurt their own health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like Schmidt, attending one of the many education programs around the country could make their lives easier. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone needs training, observed Dr. Zaldy S. Tan, medical director of UCLA’s Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care Program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter how smart, well educated, or sophisticated you are, even if you’re a physician or nurse,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Coping with caregiving&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the UCLA program, 20 to 30 caregivers receive training from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The day includes expert reports on the medical side of dementia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A physical therapist demonstrates how to use different types of walkers and canes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants can talk with other caregivers, exchanging stories and tips, and learn about ongoing support groups they can join. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also play out scenes with actors who play the part of the person with dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each person might have 5 or 10 minutes with an actor. Other caregivers then give feedback. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the scene, the caregiver might play out how they would prevent the person with dementia from leaving the house. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another scene might be about encouraging someone to take medicine. The caregiver might choose from sample food that would be best for someone with a swallowing problem. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, 84 percent of the participants have rated the program “excellent.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also report in a survey by UCLA that their sense of knowing what to do six months after their sessions remained higher than it had been before the training. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tan told Healthline that caregivers may not want to be told what to do. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They may take pride in their ways and not want to change. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They need to be prepared for the long haul,” he said, and the fact their loved one will change over time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One common mistake is to stick to low-fat or low-calorie diets even though people with dementia tend to stop eating and may lose weight. Tan recommends loosening up the diet so your loved one gets nourishment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ruth Drew, director of family and information services for the Alzheimer’s Association, a national nonprofit, encourages caregivers to look for education that allows them to participate with questions, or in support groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s important to learn to see the world through your loved one’s eyes and play along, she told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She gave the example of a husband who rigged a latch at the top of the front door too high for his wife to reach. When she’d try to open it, he’d say, “Are you having trouble with that door? There’s something wrong with it. I have to fix it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Getting into an argument, ordering them around, or treating them like children doesn’t work,” she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You also can’t force someone with dementia to learn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew encountered two adult daughters who were troubled when their mother kept asking, “When is Dad coming home?” after he had died. They would explain that he had died, and their mother would cry. They even took her to their father’s gravesite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But people with dementia have lost the ability to absorb new information, no matter how patient you are. The better move, Drew said, is to say, “Dad’s not coming home tonight. He’ll be back later in the week.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The UCLA team is looking for funding to support future boot camps. More programs are needed, said Drew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are so many people dealing with Alzheimer’s in their families, my hope is to see more education programs of every sort, with a variety of options,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer’s Association offers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alz.org/care/alzheimers-dementia-care-training-certification.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; like online training, local workshops, DVDs, and books. Its Savvy Caregiver program is a free five-session program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;One caregiver’s growth&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schmidt’s relationship with his wife has changed since he attended the UCLA boot camp two years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For years, he had been teasing Alice, intentionally making her angry. For him it was a way to have fun and he thought she might like the chance to express anger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I kind of liked it. You don’t get much attention from someone with dementia,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He didn’t think it was unkind because, he said, “She wouldn’t remember it a half-hour later.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But at boot camp, he got the message that he should stop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another lesson: Give Alice information slowly. Instead of saying, “We’re going to the bathroom to put on your makeup,” he’ll say, “We’re going to the bathroom … and I’ll tell you everything else when you get there.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In restaurants, Schmidt now orders for her. At boot camp, he told Healthline, he learned to make her choices simple: two choices at most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both he and Alice resisted suggestions that she go to a day care program. The UCLA experts recommended one, and she now goes every Thursday from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Schmidt gets a day off and has noticed that Alice is “sharper” for days afterward. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot you have to know,” he said. “You learn some by trial and error, but it’s far more effective to go to boot camp to have experts and other people with the same problem give you information and leave with practical knowledge and people you can turn to.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schmidt’s adult daughter also attended a UCLA boot camp. And he’d like to return for a refresher course to help train his 5-year-old granddaughter on how to respond to Alice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The most important thing I learned is that I’m really lucky,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He and Alice can still talk, after 40 years together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>How Dangerous is Rat Lungworm Disease?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/041917_ratlungworm_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Photo: Centers of Diseases Control and Prevention&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo: Centers of Diseases Control and Prevention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A holiday in Hawaii conjures up images of beautiful beaches and ocean views — a tropical paradise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is less likely to come to mind is a brain-invading parasite known as a rat lungworm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that was the reality for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/couple-contracts-rat-lungworm-disease-on-hawaii-honeymoon/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;newlyweds&lt;/a&gt; from California, who contracted the disease while vacationing on Maui. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The couple are two of at least nine reported cases of the disease in Hawaii so far in 2017.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say the rising number of cases is worrying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s concerning for everyone. People's health is at risk and produce growers’ livelihood is at risk,” Robert Cowie, PhD, a professor at the Pacific Biosciences Research Center at the University of Hawaii, told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is rat lungworm disease?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rat lungworm (&lt;em&gt;Angiostrongylus cantonensis&lt;/em&gt;) is a form of parasitic worm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/angiostrongylus/gen_info/faqs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, the adult parasite is found in rats, which pass the larvae of the parasite in their feces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Snails and slugs then get infected by ingesting the larvae from the feces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humans can become infected with the disease by ingesting raw or undercooked snails or slugs that have been infected by the parasite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is also possible to come into contact with the disease by eating raw produce like lettuce that hasn’t been properly washed and may have been contaminated by snails or slugs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The effects vary and can include cold and flu-like symptoms, paralysis, coma, and in rare cases, death. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;James Creecy, PhD, assistant professor at the University of Central Oklahoma’s Forensic Science Institute, has done &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480392/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; into the expansion of rat lungworm in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says the disease can in some cases lead to serious complications, like &lt;a href=&quot;/health/meningitis&quot;&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Eosinophilic meningitis is better described as white blood cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. Other symptoms include cranial nerve abnormalities, ataxia [loss of full control of bodily movements], &lt;a href=&quot;/health/encephalitis&quot;&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;, coma, and rarely death,” he told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While this all seems very bad,” he added, “the disease is rare and there is an effective treatment for human infections. Infected wildlife are not as fortunate.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC says that common types of treatment are for symptoms of the infection, rather than rat lungworm itself. Even without treatment, they say, the parasite will die over time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why disease hits Hawaii&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robert Hollingsworth, PhD, is an entomologist for the U.S. Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center, based in Hilo, Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He has done research on a species of semi-slug (&lt;em&gt;Parmarion martensi&lt;/em&gt;) that has been on the Hawaiian Islands since at least 2004. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Semi-slugs were new pests on Hawaii Island when I was asked to investigate an outbreak in 2004. The residents reporting the outbreak had all become sick from sharing a salad. That's why I sent off specimens to the CDC for testing. The specimens were highly infected,” he told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semi-slugs are considered especially dangerous in the spread of rat lungworm disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This species is high risk because it likes to climb, is relatively fast moving, and quickly locates rich food sources, and because specimens are likely to be infected by rat lungworm. More so than many other slug/snail species, they avoid soil and favor plastic and building materials. They have a penchant for getting in harm’s way,” Hollingsworth said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think of them as a ‘trash’ species that does particularly well around residences due to hiding places and the types of materials found around residences. In fact, inside and under trash cans are a favorite hiding place,” he added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cowie agrees the latest spate of incidences of the disease is most likely due to this species of semi-slug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The current outbreak on Maui seems associated with a particular species of slug [&lt;em&gt;Parmarion martensi&lt;/em&gt;] that we know to be a very good carrier of the worms. So if the outbreak is related to this species, why is it only happening now? Maybe because it has become more abundant and widespread,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Son’s infection leads to research group&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kathleen Howe became interested in rat lungworm after her son was infected with the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Susan Jarvi, of the University of Hawaii, she formed the Hawaii Island Rat Lungworm Working Group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My son contracted rat lungworm disease … was in the hospital for four months and in a coma for three months. He suffered a lot of brain and nerve damage and was not expected to recover,” Howe told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I became interested in research and education because there was no apparent research or education happening,” she added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jarvi, PhD, a professor of pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Hawaii at Hilo, says it is important people understand the dangers of rat lungworm and take proper precautions against the disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Wash vegetables thoroughly … It's also important to be educated about it and implement proper vector control,” she told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts advise people to minimize the areas slugs and snails may like to hide (such as in mulch, under plant pots, and piles of wood) and to use approved baits. It’s also important to get rid of rats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jarvi agrees the spread of the disease is most likely due to semi-slugs, but she believes there may also be another factor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The lack of action in control by the state also likely contributes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health did not respond to Healthline’s request for comment on this story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/aging/041917_superager_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that social scientists at Northwestern University have identified a group of older adults they call “SuperAgers,” whose cerebral cortexes shrink at half the rate of most older people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bad news is that so far it isn’t clear just what it is that these SuperAgers — all 80 or older — have or do that keeps their level of cognitive decline so low.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers already knew SuperAgers’ brains tend to retain more brain volume and typically don’t show the same wear-and-tear as other older adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This research was an effort to determine why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2614177&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; were published in the April 4 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unlocking the SuperAger mystery&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team used &lt;a href=&quot;/health/head-mri&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; to measure the thickness of the cortex in 24 SuperAgers and 12 cognitively average peers who were the same age and had the same level of education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over 18 months, the annual decline in thickness between the first and second visits for the SuperAgers was 1.06 percent and 2.24 percent for the control group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to understand what it is about them and eventually replicate it,” Amanda Cook, a clinical neuropsychology doctoral student in the laboratory of Emily Rogalski and Sandra Weintraub at Northwestern, told Healthline. “It’s not like all the people in that group eat blueberries every morning.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To confound the picture further, some participants say they never touch alcohol, while others swear by their daily cocktail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The normal aging process involves shrinking of the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But what’s unique about these people? There’s not much research on cognitive decline” in this population, Cook said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We tried to control outside factors,” Cook said. “Both groups of people had no difference in pre-morbidity. They had the same IQs, the same amount of education.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nor was there a difference in their rates of smoking, obesity, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t have MRIs of their brains when they were 50 or 60, so we can’t tell if they always had bigger brains,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Studying the brain&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Heather Snyder, senior director of medical and scientific operations for the Alzheimer's Association, called the study interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We want to know how they are different, and how we can replicate that for other people,” she told Healthline.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Alzheimer’s is the sixth leading cause of death in the country and the only one in the top 10 for which we have essentially no treatment,” Snyder said. “Of people over 85, 1 in 3 will develop dementia.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s known is complicated and not fully explained. Snyder cited blood pressure as an example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“High blood pressure in middle age is bad. It’s linked to cardiovascular disease. But in old age, high blood pressure is good because it feeds the brain,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Behind the scientific discoveries is the willingness to pursue them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Continued federal funding for studies is crucial,” Snyder said. “We are making progress and the need will only grow,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Focus of future research&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in the field are also encouraged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;William E. Sonntag, PhD, professor and director of Reynolds Oklahoma Center on Aging at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, discussed the issue with Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What do these people have that the rest of us don’t? That’s the key question. And this will undoubtedly be the focus of studies over the next several years,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sonntag listed some possibilities: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there are factors in the blood that help to maintain brain volume? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there a particular diet (less likely although still possible)? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are there specific genes that contribute to this effect? This is likely, although difficult to pull all the genetic effects out since it’s probably an interaction among several genes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do these SuperAgers have better vasculature (more blood vessels) in the brain (cerebrovasculature) that are critical for maintaining brain volume and function? If the blood vessels deteriorate, so does the brain. This may be why exercise appears to have a beneficial effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sonntag thought the study offered intriguing possibilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Any time that there can be a clear marker or predictor of cognitive dysfunction, the field moves forward. We can then use this marker as a way to test interventions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sonntag said the key to scientific research and the development of pharmaceutical agents that may result in maintained function is to find the specific cellular mechanisms that make this happen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Once the cellular mechanisms for this effect are identified, drugs can be developed to intervene,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bumc.bu.edu/centenarian/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New England Centenarian Study&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Thomas Perls, a geriatrician at Boston University, suggested another way to look at this field of study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,994967-1,00.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; in Time magazine in 2004, he was quoted as saying, “It's not ‘the older you get, the sicker you get,’ but ‘the older you get, the healthier you've been.’ The advantage of living to 100 is not so much how you are at 100, but how you got there.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The research was sponsored by GW Pharmaceuticals, a developer of cannabidiol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our study found that cannabidiol shows great promise in that it may reduce seizures that are otherwise difficult to control,” said study author Dr. Anup Patel, of Nationwide Children’s Hospital and The Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus and a member of the American Academy of Neurology, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What the research showed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For their double-blind, placebo-controlled study, researchers followed 225 people for 14 weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The LGS participants had an average age of 16 and had an average of 85 “drop seizures” a month. They had also tried an average of six epilepsy drugs that didn’t work for them and were taking an average of three epilepsy drugs during the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the participants were given a dose of 20 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) of cannabidiol daily. Others received a lower dose of 10 mg/kg daily or were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers said those taking the higher dose had an overall decrease of 42 percent in drop seizures. In addition, 40 percent of this group had their seizures reduced by half or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The participants taking the lower dose had an average decrease of 37 percent in seizures. About 36 percent of this group experienced a decline in seizures by half or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The placebo group saw an overall decrease of 17 percent in seizures. About 15 percent had their seizures decline by half or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers added that those in the high-dose group were 2.6 times more likely to say their overall condition had improved than the those taking the placebo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were side effects for 94 percent of those taking the higher dose and 84 percent of those taking the lower dose. About 72 percent of the placebo group reported side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the side effects were mild to moderate symptoms such as loss of appetite and sleepiness according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said there are plans to submit a new drug application for cannabidiol to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our results suggest that cannabidiol may be effective for those with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in treating drop seizures,” said Patel. “This is important because this kind of epilepsy is incredibly difficult to treat. While there were more side effects for those taking cannabidiol, they were mostly well tolerated. I believe that it may become an important new treatment option for these patients.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A growing body of evidence&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This research is the latest in a number of studies that have concluded marijuana-based products can help people with epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) has &lt;a href=&quot;http://norml.org/library/item/epilepsy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; a number of these studies on its website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also tout a &lt;a href=&quot;http://norml.org/news/2017/03/09/study-cbd-dominant-cannabis-extracts-reduce-seizure-frequency&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month that concluded cannabis oil can reduce seizure frequency in people with refractory epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On its website, the Epilepsy Foundation &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epilepsy.com/learn/treating-seizures-and-epilepsy/other-treatment-approaches/medical-marijuana-and-epilepsy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; that evidence from past research indicates cannabidiol can potentially be helpful to people with epilepsy. The organization does note that marijuana-based products have side effects. The group does support removing barriers to more cannabis research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January, Consumer Reports published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consumerreports.org/seizures/cannabis-oil-cbd-treat-seizures/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; stating that research on marijuana extracts’ ability to control seizures has been promising.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The publication, however, did urge some caution. It noted that cannabis products aren’t regulated by the FDA and that for some people taking epilepsy drugs is more effective than using marijuana-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For officials at NORML, though, the case is clear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“[The study] findings are encouraging, but not altogether surprising,” Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, told Healthline. “They confirm the testimonials of thousands of patients who have obtained seizure relief from cannabis-derived medicine when conventional treatment regimens have failed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The parents of Charlotte Figi are also convinced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2013, the 7-year-old girl with Dravet syndrome was experiencing an average of 50 seizures a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her parents, along with a Colorado-based medical marijuana group, obtained a high-concentration cannabidiol and started administering it to the young girl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The parents told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/07/health/charlotte-child-medical-marijuana/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; the medication significantly reduced their daughter’s seizures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/epi.12610/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014 report&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Epilepsia stated the girl’s seizures had been reduced to two to three nocturnal convulsions a month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said the reduction had been constant for 20 months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Armentano said it’s time for the United States to stop hampering cannabis-based research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One can only wonder how much sooner these alternative treatments would have been available and embraced by the medical community were it not for America’s longstanding stigmatization and criminalization of both cannabis and those who consume it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
;&lt;p&gt;On April 1, smoking in California became much more painful — to people’s wallets, that is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The harmful health effects of cigarette smoking are still there — things like an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And cigarette smoking still causes more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/health_effects/effects_cig_smoking/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But thanks to a statewide &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/health-and-medicine/article142084974.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ballot measure&lt;/a&gt; approved last year, California’s cigarette tax is now $2.87 — two dollars more per pack than its long-time low.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tobacco industry spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/californians-backing-cigarette-tax-boost-even-though-big-tobacco-spending-millions-67884&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$71 million&lt;/a&gt; to try to defeat this measure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the increase, California has the ninth highest cigarette tax in the country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is well below &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tobaccofreekids.org/research/factsheets/pdf/0097.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New York’s&lt;/a&gt; $4.35 per pack state tax and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/research/factsheets/pdf/0267.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chicago’s&lt;/a&gt; $6.16 per pack, which includes both state and local taxes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it’s much higher than Missouri’s almost invisible 17 cents per pack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cigarette taxes reduce smoking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal of the California tax is to increase the price of cigarettes high enough so that people quit smoking or never start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But will it work?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The simple answer is “Yes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is that significant tax increases are the single most effective way to reduce tobacco use,” Frank Chaloupka, PhD, an economist and research professor of health policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A “significant” tax means large enough for people to feel the pinch in their wallet — at least 10 percent of the current price per pack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you raise the price enough that companies can’t absorb it, or can’t offset it with their marketing practices,” said Chaloupka, “then you start to see real public health impact.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/monographs/21/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monograph&lt;/a&gt; by the National Cancer Institute, The Economics of Tobacco and Tobacco Control, found that in the United States a 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes can reduce consumption by 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), suggests that the state’s new cigarette tax will reduce its smoking rate even more. It’s currently around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/statesystem/cigaretteuseadult.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We estimated that just the price effect will cut smoking prevalence over the next five years to around 7 percent,” Stanton Glantz, PhD, professor of medicine and director of the UCSF Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, told Healthline. “And that doesn’t even account for the effect of the reinvigorated anti-smoking program.”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;States sometimes use cigarette tax revenue to also prop up the state’s budget. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But some states reinvest a portion of the money into other anti-tobacco measures, which can boost the health effects of the tax.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you reinvest some of the tax revenues back into comprehensive tobacco control programs,” said Chaloupka, “you get bigger reductions in adults smoking, bigger effects on youth smoking, and larger overall reductions in cigarette sales.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;California’s tobacco control program will receive an estimated $120 million each year from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kmir.com/story/35044990/tobacco-users-trying-to-quit-ahead-of-april-1-2-tax-increase&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new tax&lt;/a&gt;, according to a report on KMIR television.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This anti-tobacco program, started 28 years ago, has been credited with preventing more than a million early deaths due to cigarette smoking, and saving more than $138 billion in healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think with the combined effect of the big price increase and the reinvigorated anti-smoking program,” said Glantz, “we can very well wipe out tobacco as a public health problem in five years in California.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tax impacts some groups more&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All smokers will be impacted by California’s new tax, but some groups will feel it more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/resources/data/cigarette-smoking-in-united-states.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;people with low incomes&lt;/a&gt;, adults with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/media/dpk/tobacco/vs-adult-smoking/dpk-vs-adult-smoking-mental-illness.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mental illness&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/groups/lgbt.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LGBTQ community&lt;/a&gt; all have higher rates of smoking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in California, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/tobacco/Documents/CDPH%20CTCP%20Refresh/Research%20and%20Evaluation/Facts%20and%20Figures/FactsFigures2016PrePrintEditionV2.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;smoking rate&lt;/a&gt; is higher among African-Americans and Native Americans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They are, by far, carrying a much higher burden of tobacco-induced disease than the general public,” said Glantz.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with low incomes, especially, will be affected because they have less disposable income.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But they will also benefit the most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They’re the ones who are smoking, so they’re the ones who are going to pay the tax,” said Glantz. “But with the increase in price, they’re the ones who are going to quit smoking.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cigarette tax will also head off smoking among young people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We find that youth uptake of tobacco is two to three times more sensitive to price than overall tobacco users,” said Chaloupka.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The high cost of cigarettes can have a big impact on the “transition period” — when teens are moving from smoking cigarettes bummed from their friends to buying their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glantz also expects a boost to California’s economy, as he described in a post on &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/big-tobacco-aims-its-guns-to-kill-california-tobacco-tax-63750&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For every dollar spent on cigarettes — excluding taxes — 80 cents leaves the state, flowing mainly to tobacco-producing states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When people quit smoking, they spend their money on other things, such as dinner at local restaurants or going to the movies. More of this money enters the local economy, where it supports jobs and economic activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not only is the tax going to reduce smoking, reduce healthcare costs, and improve health,” said Glantz, “it’s also going to be a huge job creator in California and a huge stimulus to economic activity.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Sales of juices, teas, and other substitute beverages also went up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They noted that the sale of sugar-sweetened beverages in nearby communities rose almost 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What does the study prove?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silver said the overall impression researchers got from the study was that the soda tax is working in Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think Berkeley will be seen as a turning point,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other experts were also encouraged by the findings, but they did throw up some caution flags.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These are positive findings and they’re encouraging,” Dr. Bruce Lee, executive director of the Global Obesity Prevention Center at Johns Hopkins, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Lee noted that sales of sodas did increase in neighborhoods near Berkeley, indicating perhaps people were slipping over the city boundary to buy their sugar-sweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There may be some bleeding out into the edges,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was encouraged by the increase in water sales in Berkeley, but he was curious to see if products such as fruit juices would continue to rise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If the tax changes behavior, we want to know what it’s changing to,” Lee said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donald Marron, PhD, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, had a similar reaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marron also wondered how much of Berkeley’s soda decline was due to people driving to other towns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, he noted that tax hikes do tend to discourage consumers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you raise the price of something, people will generally buy less of it,” Marron told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marron did say there isn’t evidence yet of direct health benefits, but that’s because the soda tax hasn’t been in place long enough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lee said he expects the Berkeley tax will eventually produce health benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It can have some downstream effects,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the American Beverage Association said the story in fact acknowledges that soda taxes &quot;do not demonstrate a meaningful reduction in obesity rates.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silver said she is hopeful the tax will have an impact on conditions such as &lt;a href=&quot;/health/obesity&quot;&gt;obesity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/health/diabetes&quot;&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/health/heart-disease&quot;&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; brought on by sugar-laden products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Decreasing sugar consumption will definitely have health benefits,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Could the tax work in other places?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is Berkeley a model for other communities?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Marron and Lee pointed out that Berkeley, with its population of about 115,000, is smaller than larger metropolitan areas, but larger than many suburban and rural communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In larger towns, they said, consumers would probably be less likely to travel across city lines to avoid a soda tax.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silver doesn’t think people in Berkeley are doing that now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said researchers asked people during the phone survey if they were driving to other communities and most of them said they weren’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silver also pointed out that Berkeley’s sugar consumption is about one-third of typical communities in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She believes a tax would have an even bigger impact in towns where soda sales are higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials at the American Beverage Association said Berkeley's relatively small size and higher income and low consumption rate make it &quot;a challenging place to determine the true impact of a beverage tax.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They noted that the increase in soda sales in nearby communities indicates people are driving outside Berkeley to buy beverages. They said the same thing happened when a soda tax was imposed in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The officials added that their association is taking &quot;aggressive action&quot; to help people reduce their sugar consumption. One way they said they are accomplishing this is by offering alternative beverages. They said they are also launching a nationwide campaign with specific emphasis in places with high obesity rates such as rural Alabama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Silver did have some tips for other communities contemplating soda surcharges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said the tax should be big enough to have an impact on consumers’ wallets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An education on the health effects of sugar should accompany the tax.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, Silver said, the money collected from the tax should be spent wisely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/041817_bathbombs_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All you want is to pour yourself a glass of wine and curl up in a nice hot tub.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Better yet, you want to drop a bath bomb in that warm water and immerse yourself in luxury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bath bombs have been growing in popularity in recent years, promising everything from aromatherapy benefits to skin-soothing properties in a burst of fizz and color.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, there’s a catch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of those bath bombs you’ve come to adore may be releasing a lot more than just colored fizz into that soothing water. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consumersafety.org/about-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ConsumerSafety.org&lt;/a&gt;, a consumer advocacy group that keeps the public aware of recalls and health and safety concerns, recently launched an investigation into the components of those bath bombs you’ve come to love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And what they found might surprise you. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People are using these toxic products on a daily basis, unknowingly exposing themselves and loved ones to harmful ingredients,” Sydney Ziverts, a health and nutrition investigator who initially compiled the bath bomb research for ConsumerSafety, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What’s in a bath bomb?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To begin with, many bath bombs have the term “fragrance” listed as an ingredient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t require companies to further break down what chemicals they use to add “fragrance” to their products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Food and Drug Administration gives companies a labeling loophole for fragrances to protect a company’s proprietary perfume blend,” said Ziverts. “Therefore, companies don't legally have to disclose any toxic ingredients lingering in their fragrance blends.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some popular fragrance additives are chemicals that have actually made the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/hw/defining-hazardous-waste-listed-characteristic-and-mixed-radiological-wastes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hazardous waste list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1780852&quot;&gt;Benzene derivatives&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, are a human carcinogen linked to hormone disruption and reproductive malformation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncer_abstracts/index.cfm/fuseaction/display.highlight/abstract/2313&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aldehydes&lt;/a&gt; present an increased risk of respiratory allergies, liver disease, and embryo toxicity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/phthalates_factsheet.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phthalates&lt;/a&gt; have been found to decrease hormone levels and sperm quality as well as being linked to obesity, ovarian aging, and some forms of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then there’s talc, which has been associated with an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consumersafety.org/products/talcum-powder/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;elevated risk of ovarian cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livestrong.com/article/150690-what-are-the-dangers-of-parabens-in-skin-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parabens&lt;/a&gt; are known to disrupt the endocrine system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelhennessey/2012/08/27/living-in-color-the-potential-dangers-of-artificial-dyes/&amp;amp;refURL=https://www.google.com/&amp;amp;referrer=https://www.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;artificial dyes&lt;/a&gt; (specifically D&amp;amp;C Red 33) have been linked to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children as well as neuron damage and brain cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The debate over safety&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at Lush Cosmetics, one of the more popular distributors of bath bombs, insist their products are safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meghan Campbell, Lush’s brand and product trainer, went over safety issues ingredient by ingredient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The bright array of eye-catching colors are all derived from vegetarian food, drug, and cosmetics safe colors [FD&amp;amp;C], or drug and cosmetics safe colors [D&amp;amp;C],” she told Healthline. “The glitter is plastic-free, and even the safe synthetic that provides the famous fizz [baking soda] can be found in most kitchens. Beyond that, Lush adds lovely effective ingredients like sea salt, cocoa butter, and essential oil-based fragrance blends, bespoke to each and every hand-pressed bath bomb.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said customer safety and satisfaction is their top priority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Lush would never put an ingredient in a bath bomb that we’d want people to steer clear of,” Campbell said. “We want you in the tub, not running from it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Ziverts found Lush’s explanation somewhat lacking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Very interesting given the ingredients listed on their page(s),” she said in an email to Healthline. “Specifically related to Lush, I wanted to show you &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lushusa.com/bath/fun/pink/9999903769.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Although it’s a bubble ‘mold’ and not a bath bomb, you’ll notice the first ingredient listed is talc, which has a direct correlation to ovarian cancer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are alternatives to bath bombs, such as the ones here listed on the blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abeautifulwhim.com/ingredients-bath-bombs-dangerous/beauty/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a beautiful whim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a fragrance fix use scented candles or incense. You’ll still get that calming aroma without steeping yourself in unknown chemicals — and the soft light will set the mood for relaxing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If bubbles are your thing, and you don’t want to spring for a jacuzzi, you can find natural recipes &amp;nbsp;for making bubble bath all over the internet. Here’s one from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.diynatural.com/homemade-bubble-bath/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DIY Natural&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is it the eye-popping color that you crave? There are much safer options to consider than dipping yourself in dyes. Look for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.superbrightleds.com/moreinfo/novelty-lighting/submersible-rgb-led-tea-lights-led-candle-lights-floralytes/1416/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;submersible LED lights&lt;/a&gt; that can illuminate your bath from below.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to relinquish your bath bombs, at least seek out talc-free options, and products scented with recognizable ingredients rather than “fragrances.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, there’s always the option of making &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popsci.com/how-to-make-your-own-bath-bombs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;your own bath bombs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That way you control the ingredients list, and you know exactly what you’re soaking in. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

ht diagnosis means everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In some cases, it can be a matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jep.12747/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice found that more than 20 percent of patients who went for a second opinion at the Mayo Clinic had, in fact, been misdiagnosed by their primary care doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors are human and ailments are complex, so misdiagnoses are nothing new.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What can prevent patients from being inaccurately diagnosed?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Accuracy of new blood tests&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One tool is a blood test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s not always been a test for everything out there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there are a few new pathology exams (and more on the horizon) that can help doctors better detect diseases and conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are three recent developments:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viral vs. bacterial infections&lt;/strong&gt;: Wouldn’t it be great to know if you really need an antibiotic or if you should just let a cold run its course?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Duke University team is looking into the efficacy of a test that could distinguish viral from bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Geoffrey S. Ginsburg previously &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/tech-new-blood-test-sorts-out-viral-and-bacterial-infections-091813#2&quot;&gt;told Healthline&lt;/a&gt; that he would love to have the “pregnancy test equivalent to viral infections.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heart attack&lt;/strong&gt;: Researchers at King's College London created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2017/04-April/Heart-attacks-diagnosed-quicker-by-new-blood-test.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blood test&lt;/a&gt; that better detects heart muscle damage due to a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a doctor suspects that a patient has had an attack, only some incidents show changes on a heart trace or ECG. Those exams test levels of cardiac troponin, which is a protein released by the heart that is common after heart attacks or inflammation. When doctors can’t find cardiac troponin in the blood, patients are labeled as low-risk and typically discharged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers, however, looked at 4,000 patients and found that 47 percent of those actually had an intermediate risk and required more tests. Their test for myosin-binding protein C is a better indicator of how much heart muscle has been damaged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tom Kaier, a cardiologist with Kings College London, told Healthline that the myosin-binding protein C is present in greater abundance and may rise quicker than troponin after a heart attack. That could change the way heart attacks are diagnosed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Troponin is an excellent test, but it has its limitations. It takes over three hours to appear in adequate levels in the bloodstream to be measured reliably,” Kaier noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Considering that only 14 to 17 percent of patients that go to emergency rooms with chest pain have a heart attack, the other 80 percent want reassurance as soon as possible. A quicker diagnosis may also improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The detection of myosin-binding protein C “appears in the circulation quicker, and thus could rule out heart attacks in more patients at an earlier time point than currently possible,” Kaier added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concussions/traumatic brain injuries: &lt;/strong&gt;Accurately diagnosing a concussion or traumatic brain injury can be a bit of a guessing game when it comes to specifying the severity of the impairment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Dr. Linda Papa, an emergency medicine physician and researcher at Orlando Health released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/03/160328114638.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Neurology&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;detailing a blood test that measures a protein released by brain cells upon an injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More of the protein indicates a higher severity of brain injury, she explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of a brain injury can be subtle and may not come on for several days. She told Healthline that diagnosing a concussion can be “very subjective” and is “often based on the experience of the clinician.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a person doesn’t see a brain expert, they may not be accurately diagnosed, so having a concrete test to confirm injury would be a big step. A CAT scan can give an assessment of a brain injury, but it only detects lesions and cannot detect all of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having a definitive blood test could help doctors make better treatment decisions sooner —hopefully leading to better patient outcomes, Papa said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Papa’s test would be the first of its kind. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re just a couple of years from it being available,” she added. “We’re hoping the blood test will find injury where it couldn’t be seen before.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Papa noted that it was also tested in patients of all ages with severe traumatic brain injury and seems to “cover the spectrum” of brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The future of precision pathology&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael J. Donovan, a pathologist and researcher at The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said there are many new innovations happening with blood tests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also developments in tests to evaluate urine, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the oncology field, for instance, researchers are looking at cell-free DNA, which is the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in blood that can be isolated and sequenced to identify cancer-related genes with mutations in them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors then can tell if a cancer drug will work on the patient. The blood acts as a companion diagnostic to gauge the efficacy of a drug before it’s even given. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s one of the very practical ways in which the field has advanced,” Donovan told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other blood test innovations include evaluations that can predict how a kidney transplant patient will respond. This can replace an invasive biopsy. Researchers are also targeting urine tests in this area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donovan said that blood tests in the future may also be able to determine if a patient is building a response to human papillomavirus (HPV) in a lesion instead of having to biopsy it or conduct an intrusive cell scraping. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blood tests are also a pathway to evaluate the possibility of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re always looking for ways to detect the manifestation of Alzheimer’s prior to actual clinical manifestations,” Donovan said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other liquid biopsy options could evaluate a patient’s immune system via bloodwork so doctors can monitor an individual’s state via a simple blood draw. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Assessing DNA isn’t the only research pathway, either, as researchers are looking to evaluate peptide fragments in the blood. Peptides are amino acids that are linked via peptide bonds and in some ways are similar to DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DNA gives a blueprint of genes, while RNA helps to execute the DNA’s guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Donovan said that the field of liquid biopsies will continue to evolve — again, not just via bloodwork but through spinal fluid, saliva, and urine. That will give doctors multiple tools to better diagnose patients and hopefully improve outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we see in blood under a microscope, that will pull together a more comprehensive genotype of a person,” Donovan said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s the future of precision pathology,” Donovan added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

It takes away opportunities to seek treatments that might not be abortion.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How many cases it would affect is hard to say. Rocap said that’s in part because many such cases settle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/why-abortion-rates-have-decreased&quot;&gt;Read more: Why the abortion rate is decreasing &raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is the definition of “wrong&quot;?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Texas was the first state to recognize wrongful birth legal actions, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.senate.texas.gov/cmtes/84/c610/021816-AllianceForLife-c3.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;presentation &lt;/a&gt;the advocacy group Texas Alliance for Life made in support of the proposed law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The current law has been challenged three times and upheld each time, group members told the state senate’s Health and Human Services Committee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group said 28 states recognize this law, but nine have since eliminated it through legislative action.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Texas, the debate began after a &lt;a href=&quot;http://law.justia.com/cases/texas/supreme-court/1975/b-4583-0.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1975 case&lt;/a&gt; in which a pregnant woman came down with &lt;a href=&quot;/health/rubella&quot;&gt;rubella&lt;/a&gt; during her first trimester and later gave birth to a child with defective major organs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She and her husband sued their doctor for not diagnosing the rubella or telling them about how it might affect the fetus. They won.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A modern risk could come from something like the Zika virus, which can cause microcephaly and developmental delays in babies of infected mothers. There have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://texaszika.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;330 cases&lt;/a&gt; of Zika in Texas in the past three years, according to the state’s health services department.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But saying that it’s “wrong” to give birth to a child who is born impaired is wrong, said Scheidler.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Children aren’t mistakes. That’s horrific that someone’s birth could be wrong,” he said. “We make such an effort to accommodate people with disabilities in this country, and this is a direct contradiction of that really excellent institution that the American people have set up. To say that there are people who shouldn’t be born sends a terrible message.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scheidler speaks from experience. He has a niece who he says can’t walk or talk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The idea that her life is a mistake?,” he asks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/why-planned-parenthood-wont-accept-no-abortion-deal&quot;&gt;Read more: Why Planned Parenthood won’t accept President Trump’s ‘no abortion’ deal &raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The case for “wrongful birth”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Defenders of the legal avenue say they are focused on potential parents having all the necessary information to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They add they want to ensure there aren’t situations in which a doctor who opposes abortion rights might impose their beliefs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Doctors have high ethics and are not in the practice of lying to their patients. But the question is, are there doctors out there who would do that if they could get away with it?” said Rocap. “If it’s so rare why take it off the books?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rocap says rolling back the wrongful birth legal option would only ban a specific and rare set of malpractice suits.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs could still sue over other possible malpractice — like if the doctor were to do something harmful in the delivery of the child. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bill passed the Texas Senate on March 20 and it is now moving through the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

By 2014 that number increased to 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Based on our data, we estimate that millions of Americans have a level of emotional functioning that leads to lower quality of life and life expectancy,” Weissman said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, she told Healthline, adults with SPD “appear to have more chaotic and less effective use of healthcare compared to those without, hence they are in poorer health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Multiple mental health problems&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compounding the problem of accessibility, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://today.duke.edu/2017/04/wiring-%E2%80%98little-brain%E2%80%99-linked-multiple-forms-mental-illness&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; from Duke University also points out that those with mental illness may often suffer from more than just one disorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers examined the prevalence and potential reasons for “comorbidity” a term used to describe when an individual has multiple mental disorders at once. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Approximately half of individuals who meet the criteria for a single mental disorder will also meet the criteria for a second disorder, researchers say. That makes treatment even more difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Clinically, comorbidity is associated with greater severity of impairment and complexity in treatment planning, compliance, and coordination of services,” the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers examined the “p-factor,” a statistical way to measure the overlap of different kinds of mental illness, such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A person with many of these issues would have a higher p-factor score than someone with one mental health condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Practically, “the p-factor suggests that there may be a general factor of psychopathology” that can be accounted for. The study authors say that this could provide a new way to approach treatment of mental illness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If we continue to find support for the link between the ‘p-factor’ and the cerebellum, our research raises interesting questions about when and how this link emerges and how we might use that information to intervene more effectively,” study authors Ahmad Hariri, PhD, and Adrienne Romer, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There may be more efficient ways of treating mental illnesses by targeting their shared characteristics,” they said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Pedometers May Be a Step in the Right Direction for RA Patients

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/tech/041517_pedometer_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to rheumatoid arthritis (RA), taking any steps can be painful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.23230/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; shows that taking those steps while wearing a pedometer can be beneficial for symptom management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, fitness trackers can help people with RA, whether or not they choose to set specific goals or track the number of steps they take each day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in the study concluded that the act of simply wearing a pedometer can motivate people with RA to keep moving and stay active.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said that perhaps the most telling result in their study was a reduction in patient fatigue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may prove to be of interest to RA patients and rheumatologists alike, as fatigue is one of the most difficult RA symptoms to treat. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/pain-management/fatigue/beat-fatigue.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Arthritis Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, up to 98 percent of people with RA report fatigue as a symptom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;On the move&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest study followed 96 participants. All but eight finished the 21-week assessment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings were published in the Arthritis Care &amp;amp; Research medical journal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It found that providing pedometers to people with RA, without providing step targets, successfully increased activity while also diminishing fatigue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The notion of exercise as a way to mitigate RA pain and fatigue isn’t new. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, the Arthritis Foundation has run campaigns with slogans like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=illnWGwxNfg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Let’s Move Together&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also formerly partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a campaign called &lt;a href=&quot;http://oaaction.unc.edu/arthritis-foundation-joins-get-moving-america-campaign-for-osteoarthritis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get Moving America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While rheumatologists used to dissuade patients from exercise, now they encourage light activity such as water aerobics, tai chi, chair yoga, resistance band training, and walking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pedometers may be the next step&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But pedometers may be the next recommendation they make.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2011 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3042669/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that activity — in the form of aerobic and resistance exercise training — was key in fatigue reduction and management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The latest study encouraged the intervention of pedometers to encourage movement of any kind in any quantity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A review of studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association revealed that people — with or without a medical issue —&amp;nbsp; who wore a fitness tracker or pedometer to record their steps increased their step count by at least 27 percent per day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may be worth considering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With heart disease and muscle cachexia being closely linked to RA, perhaps the next prescription someone with RA should fill is that of a pedometer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Because rheumatoid arthritis medications have only small effects on fatigue, it's important for patients to have other ways to manage their fatigue,” said Patricia Katz, PhD, who was the lead author of the recent Arthritis Care &amp;amp; Research study. “These results suggest that something as simple as increasing physical activity by walking can help.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This relatively simple intervention helped a very sedentary group of rheumatoid arthritis patients increase their activity at a level that is considered clinically significant,” Lucas Carr PhD, of the University of Iowa, who wasn’t involved in the study, told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/health/pedometers-tied-to-less-fatigue-for-rheumatoid-arthritis-patient/3679290.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Channel News Asia&lt;/a&gt;. “The largest health benefits are realized when an individual changes from doing nothing to doing something.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Overall, this study further confirms the importance of physical activity for people with RA,” concluded Katz. “Not only does it help to reduce fatigue — as shown in this study — it may improve mood, help a patient maintain a healthy weight, improve cardiovascular risk factors, and improve overall functioning.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some skeptics have likened the company to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/09/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-exclusive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Theranos&lt;/a&gt;, a biotech start-up that was valued at $9 billion before an investigation by the Wall Street Journal led to a shutdown of the company’s labs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Samumed has been more open about presenting their data to the public — but not about the actual treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We're basically telling everyone, here's proof that it works,” Samumed Chief Executive Officer, Osman Kibar, told Business Insider. “How it works — you just need to wait a little longer because we want to build as much of a head start as we can.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Other stem cell research&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond the applications of stem cells at Samumed, the technology is also being used to treat some of the United States’ most widespread health issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New &lt;a href=&quot;http://jaha.ahajournals.org/content/6/4/e003918&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from the American Heart Association this month demonstrated the effectiveness of implanted stem cells into the hearts of people with &lt;a href=&quot;/health/heart-disease/cardiomyopathy&quot;&gt;cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the sample size was small (only 27 people), scientists noted “function and symptomatic improvements” of heart functioning as well as less frequency of hospitalization and lower medical costs. They conclude that the stem cell procedure is “a feasible treatment for cardiomyopathy,” but they note that a larger clinical follow-up is needed for more conclusive results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past week, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsweek.com/2017/04/21/stem-cell-spray-skingun-renovacare-burns-582079.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Newsweek&lt;/a&gt; reported on “miracle” stem cell treatments for burn victims that will promote healing without scars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/10/parkinsons-disease-stem-cells/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stat News&lt;/a&gt; wrote about research on stem cells in mice that could potentially help cure Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Measured optimism&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some researchers in the industry are somewhat measured in their optimism of the technology’s human applications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I want to make sure that we provide a real cautionary note, especially to those individuals and those institutions that tout stem cells as the panacea for any ill,” Dr. Cato Laurencin, director of the Institute for Regenerative Engineering at the University of Connecticut, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Laurencin, a medical practitioner at the forefront of stem cell technology, is a firm believer in the benefits of the treatment, but also remains skeptical of some of the claims associated with it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Much of the evidence is still preliminary or anecdotal, and when people operate on information that is preliminary or anecdotal, there is the possibility for harm,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His work in regenerative engineering — a term he coined several years ago — looks at the healing properties of implanted stem cells in the human body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0174789&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published this month, Laurencin and his team concluded that stem cells effectively improved healing to torn rotator cuff tendons in rats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rotator cuff tendon tears are a relatively common injury in humans and can be difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike other tendons in the body, the rotator cuff tendon is unable to heal itself, said Laurencin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once it is torn, it is liable to be reinjured again and again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the research released this month is about more than just applying stem cells to a certain kind of injury, it’s about how the stem cells are applied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nanotechnology and other advances&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Laurencin describes his field as an evolution of earlier work from 30 years ago in tissue engineering: a convergence of “bringing together new technologies to create new science and new possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this case, nanotechnology is at the heart of this stem cell operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently there are a variety of ways that stem cells can be implanted into a subject, including injections and bone marrow transplants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For his research, Laurencin and his team used “biomaterial based fiber matrices” — a nanomaterial conducive to growing and attaching stem cells — to implant into the wounded area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results are promising, but Laurencin and his team will have to continue working with animals for some time before the process can be applied to humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The key is in understanding that stem cells have the potential for more than just regrowing damaged parts of the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The way we commonly think about a stem cell is it becoming a new tissue. But we’re also understanding that the stem cell itself can secrete biological factors that help regeneration occur. That’s what we think is happening here,” said Laurencin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His research into stem cells as a medicinal element in the body could have far reaching implications for all kinds of wound therapy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite his measured approach, Laurencin is still willing to hypothesize about the excitement that the future of the field undoubtedly holds — with proper time, funding, and research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are newts and salamanders that can regenerate a limb,” he told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How do we harness the cues that are taking place in these types of animals, and can we utilize what we’ve learned from these types of animals in humans?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo: American Heart Association News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baseball Hall of Famer and recent transplant recipient Rod Carew now knows whose heart and kidney are keeping him alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those organs are from Konrad Reuland, an National Football League (NFL) tight end who died following a ruptured brain aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is believed to be the first such transplant involving pro athletes. Yet that’s only one of many links the men shared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another is that Reuland went to middle school with Carew’s children, so donor and recipient crossed paths before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Figuring out the connection&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mutual friends immediately connected the dots between Reuland’s death and Carew’s new chance at life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working together, the families discovered it likely was true, then got it confirmed by the local organ procurement network.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On March 2, the families met at the Reuland home for a remarkable reunion – one family filled with joy, the other still grieving, both bonded by a young man’s selfless gift.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You’re a part of our family now,” Mary Reuland, Konrad’s mom, told Carew and his wife, Rhonda.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yes,” Carew said. “Forever.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ralf Reuland, Konrad’s father, is a physician.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using one of his stethoscopes, he, Mary and their youngest son Austin each heard Konrad’s heart thumping inside Rod’s chest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Mary listened, the edges of her mouth widened and her eyebrows jumped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There it is,” she said softly, breaking into a full smile and laying her head onto Rod’s shoulder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Does it sound the same?” Rhonda said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary lifted her head, nodded and said, “I’ve got it memorized.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Ralf heard the beat, he pressed his eyes shut. He opened his mouth but didn’t speak. A moment later he said, “Welcome home Konrad.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Young heart goes to family hero&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Konrad died Dec. 12. He was 29.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the final hours Mary spent with her oldest child, she kept her right ear on his chest. Her final words to the representative of the organ procurement network were, “Make sure his heart goes to a really good person because Konrad was a really good person.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon learning Konrad’s heart might’ve gone to Carew, Mary could hardly breathe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She remembered going to the Anaheim Angels’ stadium as a child with her dad and brothers to watch him play. Carew was her favorite player.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She then researched Carew. Reading about his character and charity work – and that he, too, had endured the pain of burying a child – she decided he was a worthy recipient. She told him so when they met.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Thank you,” Carew said. “I will take care of this heart. Because I’ve been given a second chance. God knows how I feel and what I’m going to do for Him.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whenever organs are transplanted into famous people – and whenever those people are Carew’s age, 71 – questions arise about preferential treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add in the pro sports connection and their shared past, and this case is sure to draw even more scrutiny. However, strict protocols ensured the donation process was anonymous. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Had the Reulands wanted Carew to have Konrad’s organs, they could’ve steered them his way. It’s called a “directed donation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also noteworthy is that Carew’s health placed him so high on the waiting list despite his age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are so thankful, so grateful, so … there aren’t adequate words,” Rhonda told the Reulands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A young life taken&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The full story of this transplant seems like something conjured in nearby Hollywood. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tale begins with Konrad attending St. John’s Episcopal School in Rancho Santa Margarita, California, from sixth through eighth grades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rhonda’s daughter Cheyenne was there all three years, and her son Devon also was there Konrad’s final year. Devon was later basketball teammates with Konrad’s younger brother Warren.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Future donor and recipient likely interacted several times. The first encounter left quite an impression on Konrad, who was around 11.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All he talked about for the rest of that day was, `I met Rod Carew!’” Mary said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A basketball star in his early teens, Konrad began playing football and became the nation’s top tight end coming out of high school. He went to Notre Dame, then transferred to Stanford, spending three seasons as a teammate of his brother, Warren.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Konrad played several seasons in the NFL with the New York Jets and Baltimore Ravens. He also spent time with the San Francisco 49ers and Indianapolis Colts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Colts released him last August, so he spent the fall working out at home with his youngest brother, Austin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After years of being slowed by a torn knee ligament and foot surgery, Konrad was in the best shape of his life – a taut 6-foot-6, 270 pounds – while waiting for a team to call.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also had begun preparing for life after football. He took part in an NFL Business Academy at the University of Michigan last spring, then began dabbling in commercial real estate by buying a four-unit apartment complex. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two days after Thanksgiving, he was on a treadmill when he felt “a click” behind his left eye and a severe headache. That was the emergence of the aneurysm, a ballooning of an artery in his brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It burst a few days later. A 17-hour operation followed. He never woke from a coma, his brain activity ceasing about two weeks later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A life saved&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carew’s medical odyssey began in September 2015 when he suffered a near-fatal heart attack while playing golf.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He spent a year with a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, in his chest handling the work of his damaged heart. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last fall, blood thinners he took as part of his LVAD protocol led to bleeding in his brain, making it more urgent for him to get a new heart. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He went on the transplant waiting list the Friday before Thanksgiving and moved higher a few weeks later. He got the call that a match was found on Dec. 14. He received the heart and kidney two days later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scene that would forever bind Carew and Reuland occurred last April in the kitchen of Mary and Ralf’s home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary was cooking dinner while Konrad was renewing his driver’s license. He asked her whether he should become an organ donor. She called it a personal choice, so he asked what her choice was. She said she’d signed up to do it, so he did, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The families learned about their possible connection from their overlapping networks of friends. For instance, Devon Carew and Warren Reuland are Facebook friends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Word began to spread in Orange County, then across the sports world among people who knew of both sagas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only details the Carews received prior to the transplant were that the donor was “male, late 20s, local, exceptionally healthy.” They later learned his exact age: 29.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Reulands were told the recipient was a 71-year-old man from Orange County who was treated at Cedars-Sinai.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While such a wide age discrepancy might seem odd, the key factor was Hepatitis B. Both were immune. Nobody ahead of Carew on the transplant list was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Timing and blood type worked out, too. Ultimately, Rod happened to be the right guy in the right place when the wrong thing happened to Konrad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Getting out the word&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now both families aim to harness the power of this story to help more people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They want to draw attention to heart disease and brain health, hopefully spurring people to step up their prevention efforts. Heart disease and stroke are the world’s leading causes of death. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart disease has touched the Reulands, too. Mary lost her father and a 31-year-old brother to heart attacks; Ralf’s father has received a stent and battles atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both families want to encourage more people to become organ donors. To understand the difference one donor can make, consider that Konrad’s organs and tissues could go to several hundred people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The full extent won’t be known for about a year. Carew’s family has long been signed up as organ donors in memory of his daughter, Michelle, who died of leukemia when she was unable to get a match for a bone marrow transplant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Reulands also are seeking donations for an endowment fund in Konrad’s name through Big Brothers Big Sisters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gofundme.com/in-celebration-of-konrad-reuland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Another fund&lt;/a&gt; was established by the football coach at Mission Viejo High School for a plaque that will hang under the scoreboard at the stadium, with any leftover money going to a scholarship fund.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The families look forward to working together – especially on “Heart of 29,” the campaign Carew started last year with the American Heart Association.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The program’s name came from the jersey number that Carew wore throughout his career. Because Konrad died at 29, the name carries added meaning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The whole thing is just unbelievable,” Rod said. “I’ve been given a second chance so I’m going to take advantage of it. And I’ve got another family. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is going to be great.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/baseball-great-rod-carews-new-heart-kidney-came-from-nfl-player-konrad-reuland/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;original story&lt;/a&gt; was published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Heart Association News.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/041617_spouserelated_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joke that married couples can appear similar may in fact be due to the tendency for couples to marry someone from a similar ancestry — whether they are aware of it or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s according to a new study published recently in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006655#sec020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the first ever investigation into mating patterns across multiple generations in the United States, researchers examined genetic similarities between spouses in three generations of families. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The participants took part in the Framingham Heart Study, which has examined the heart health of residents in Framingham, Mass., since 1948. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, the Boston University School of Public Health, and the University of California San Francisco found that of the 879 spouse participants, those from Northern European, Southern European, and Ashkenazi backgrounds were more likely to choose a spouse from the same ancestry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Seeking similar backgrounds&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers say choosing a partner from a similar background could be due to a number of reasons. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mate choice reflects a large number of factors including local geodemographics, social class, nationality, ethnicity, religion, anthropometric traits such as height and weight, as well as behavioral characteristics,” the researchers &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006655#sec020&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These patterns may also have reflected neighborhood characteristics, and the tendency for unions to occur locally.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study found that those from later generations were less likely to choose a spouse from the same ancestry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Intermixing between participants with Northwestern and Southern European ancestries was relatively uncommon in the original cohort but increased in subsequent generations,” they wrote.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may be due to the tendency for younger generations to move around more frequently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While unions historically have been preferentially local, increased movements of the population over past decades are contributing to the decay of local endogamy, as seen in Framingham,” the researchers found. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Are there health concerns?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genetic similarity within a population is of particular significance in the area of genomic studies as it can lead to false positives in identifying gene regions associated with disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can also impact estimations of the degree to which a disease may be passed on genetically. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over several generations, the tendency for people to pick a mate from a similar ancestry has resulted in a genetic structure that has potential to bias results of genetic studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Peter Ralph from the Institute of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Oregon, says that in small populations, genetic similarity can also have health consequences. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In very genetically similar populations there are often increased risks of some genetic diseases, because it is effectively more likely someone gets two broken copies of some particular gene.&amp;nbsp;In practice, this only shows up in very small populations, or ones that have been very small in the recent past,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ralph emphasizes that the findings of this study shouldn’t be misinterpreted.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is an implication in some of the news about this study that there's some genetic cause that makes people find more similar spouses but that's not supported by this study at all [or claimed by the authors],” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Noah Rosenberg, PhD, is a professor of population genetics and society at Stanford University. He says the research could pave the way for improving genetic studies of disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Many research methods in human genetics rely on an assumption that people choose mates randomly within a population. Although this of course is not how people choose mates, real populations often are close enough to random mating for the research methods to work properly,” he told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study disentangles the component of nonrandom mating that is due to assortative mating by ancestry, evaluating changing preferences that people have had over time in a New England town for mates from similar ancestral backgrounds. It finds a way to improve genetic studies of disease to account for the effects of assortative mating by ancestry.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/041417_companyfitness_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven years ago, many city employees of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.plantation.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Plantation, Fla.&lt;/a&gt;, had high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar levels — all risk factors for chronic health problems like &lt;a href=&quot;/health/heart-disease&quot;&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/health/type-2-diabetes&quot;&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These diseases can worsen a person’s quality of life and increase their chances of dying early.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But they also cost companies big money in missed workdays, higher medical costs, and lowered productivity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2016, employee absenteeism — missing work because of sickness or injury — drained the U.S. economy of $2 billion, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2016/15_0503.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was due to just five health conditions — high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are all too common in the American workforce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC report found that up to 56 percent of employees surveyed were physically inactive, 30 percent were obese, and 27 percent were smokers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Building a healthier workforce&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Faced with this kind of drain on its resources, Plantation did what many companies across the country are increasingly doing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They set up a workplace wellness program to address employees’ existing chronic health conditions and head off future problems by helping people lead healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2012, around half of all companies with at least 50 employees offered some kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2015/06/claims-wellness-cost-savings-overblown-rand/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wellness program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These vary from company to company. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Employees are often prodded to undergo screenings for risk factors of chronic diseases — and to take steps to reduce their risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Programs may include lifestyle management activities like gym memberships, yoga classes, weight loss programs, nutrition classes, smoking cessation programs, and nutrition classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s also programs to help people manage existing chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plantation’s program is more comprehensive than many.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The city works with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www1.marathon-health.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marathon Health&lt;/a&gt; to provide an onsite health center to employees. This includes primary care services provided by doctors, health coaching, and a pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This approach has helped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Margie Moale, the city’s human resources director, told Healthline that 68 percent of Plantation’s employees are now making progress in improving health risk factors such as blood pressure and body mass index (BMI).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other companies have seen similar improvements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jodi McWilliams, benefit manager for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ki.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;KI&lt;/a&gt;, a global furniture manufacturing firm based in Wisconsin, said that in recent years many of its almost 2,000 employees have lowered their health risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This enables employees to move into a “healthier” category — and pay less for their health insurance. This can be a big incentive for them to take care of their health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For people whose risk scores are poor, KI offers programs like Weight Watchers, health coaching, or smoking cessation classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If employees complete these programs — but not necessarily succeed at them — they earn points toward moving to a cheaper insurance premium.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They’re not guaranteed to walk out of Weight Watchers and have lost 10 pounds,” said McWilliams. “It’s just that they went through it and now maybe they know how to eat healthier.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Healthier workers, lower costs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since Plantation opened its employee health center in 2010, it has saved close to $4 million in healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moale attributes this decrease in part to catching health problems earlier when they are cheaper to treat or manage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Employees can also visit a doctor at the health center during the workday — on city time. This greater accessibility means employees don’t have to put off seeing a doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a Plantation employee went to the health center for a sinus infection, her doctor encouraged her to have a mammogram that day, something she had been putting off for three years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The result came back the next day — breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But doctors caught it early enough to treat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If this total health management program wasn’t in place, that woman would have ended up probably losing her life,” said Moale. “As it was, it was caught early enough, she had her surgery, and she’s healthy now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michele McDermott, senior vice-president of human resources at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.assuranceagency.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Assurance&lt;/a&gt;, an independent insurance brokerage, said that healthier employees are also good for the whole company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not only is it helping the company, because our costs for the medical plan on the employer’s side are staying the same or improving,” McDermott told Healthline, “but we’re passing that along to our employees by not increasing their cost for participating in the plan.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthier employees may also be more productive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.endocrine.org/news-room/current-press-releases/participation-in-a-weight-management-program-reduces-job-absenteeism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, University of Michigan researchers found that employees who completed six months of a two-year weight loss program showed up at work more regularly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before the program, people reported working, on average, 5.2 hours per month less than their employer expected. After half a year, they were working 6.4 hours more than expected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plantation experienced a similar improvement in employee attendance after its health center opened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In the first four years of operation of the care center, my absenteeism rate was down by 50 percent,” said Moale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 92 participants in the University of Michigan study also lost, on average, 41 pounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379709004863#bib84&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2009 review&lt;/a&gt; of studies looking at workplace wellness programs, researchers estimated that losing 10 percent of your body weight — and keeping it off — would save $3,116 to $7,504 in lifetime medical costs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Are wellness programs worth the cost?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, workplace wellness is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2015/06/claims-wellness-cost-savings-overblown-rand/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$6 billion industry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of this expense goes to running wellness programs. The 2009 review found that weight loss competitions — along the lines of “The Biggest Loser” — cost employers between $1.60 and $4.16 per pound lost by employees. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given that kind of upfront expense, many employers want to know if they are saving more than they are putting into wellness programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP50433.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt;, RAND researchers looked at a large workplace wellness program offered by PepsiCo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For every dollar that the company spent on helping employees manage chronic illnesses, the company saved $3.78 in healthcare costs and reduced absenteeism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the lifestyle program — focused on things like eating better, exercising more, and quitting smoking — cost more to run than the company saved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combined, the two programs saved the company $1.46 for every dollar invested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies looking for a bigger return on their investment may want to focus on workers’ existing chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, that’s not to say that wellness programs that lose money on paper aren’t worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Assurance’s McDermott has noticed an increase in employee engagement in recent years, something the company measures every six months with a five-question survey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She thinks this is partly related to the company’s wellness program, as are other less tangible benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t have as high a turnover as some of our competitors,” said McDermott, “because our employees are happy, they’re engaged, and they like the programs we offer. And they enjoy the camaraderie that our wellness program creates.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Employees embracing healthy living can also spill out beyond the workplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;KI’s McWilliams said that more employees are taking advantage of monetary incentives for entering walk, run, or bike races. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Those types of things are the ones that we really like to see, because it’s getting not only the employee involved, but maybe their spouse and maybe their kids,” said McWilliams, “and they’re out there in the community promoting wellness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Either they’ve already had children or they have made the decision not to have them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But for women who still yearn to be mothers, that clock becomes louder and louder the further into their 30s they get.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As most women know, 35 seems to be the magic number when doctors start to get nervous about a woman’s fertility. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reasons for that heightened sense of urgency are well documented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are countless studies depicting the decline of female fertility with age, which is why the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Female-Age-Related-Fertility-Decline&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;committee opinion&lt;/a&gt; reflecting that clinical and scientific data in 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In that opinion, they cited research that found that over the course of 12 insemination cycles, 74 percent of women younger than 31 achieved pregnancy, 62 percent of women aged 31 to 35 had similar success, and only 54 percent of women over 35 were able to get pregnant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, a consistent increase in miscarriage rates has been found as women progress through their 30s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigating the reasons, the general rule of thumb is that women over the age of 35 trying to conceive should receive more aggressive treatment than those under 35.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;None of this is new information. But the problem is, the scientific and medical communities have yet to come up solid reasons for why this happens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(10)01001-8?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0960982210010018%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&amp;amp;cc=y=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; have hypothesized the “cohesion loss” theory as an explanation for why this decline occurs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That theory was predicated on the concept that older eggs suffered from a loss of cohesion as the “glue” that holds the chromosomes together ceased to work as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, a recent study involving mice points to another potential complication. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30162-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; released early this month out of the University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre has found that older eggs in mice also appear to have instability at the microtubule level. That contributes to abnormal cell division.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While these microtubules typically assemble a “spindle in a controlled symmetrical fashion,” in older eggs, the microtubules instead assemble in all directions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But how accurate are these mice studies in predicting what is responsible for the decline in female fertility among the human population?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthline reached out to Dr. Alan Copperman, director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility at RMA of New York, with that very question. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The mouse model is often relied upon as the primary mammalian model for genetic research, since despite there being some differences with regard to ovarian senescence, or aging, mice ovaries express many genetic and physiological similarities to humans,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How the research might help&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So … we may now have a better idea of what causes the decline in fertility women begin to experience in their 30s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what good does knowing the reasons really do?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Copperman, it could potentially do a lot of good.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ovarian aging is the most common limiting factor to a woman/couple’s success of conceiving a healthy pregnancy,” he explained. “Understanding the mechanisms by which aging eggs acquire problems with their cellular machinery that lead to an imbalance of genetic material could one day help us to find a therapeutic target for treatments to address the problem of ovarian aging and its effects on embryo quality.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which means that this latest research could actually help to contribute to a solution further down the line. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s certainly a goal the researchers have in mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are currently exploring possible treatments for eggs that might one day make it possible to reverse this problem and rejuvenate the eggs,” Greg Fitzharris, a co-author of the Montreal study, and an associate professor at the university, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Could we really be heading toward a future where turning 35 doesn’t mean a woman will then be reminded of her ticking clock by ever person she meets?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research is still many years off from getting to that point, but with a growing understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to female fertility decline comes a greater ability to address those issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/100616_homeopathicteething_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyland Inc. has finally given in to pressure from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and recalled two of its teething tablet products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its website, the company issued &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hylands.com/media/news-press-release/hylands-teething-update&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;, saying it had made the &quot;very difficult decision&quot; to pull from store shelves its Baby Teething Tablets and its Nighttime Baby Teething Tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Company officials said no other Hyland products are affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it believes the two recalled products are safe, but Hyland is &quot;adhering&quot; to what the FDA has requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April. 7, FDA officials issued a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/%40fdagov-afda-orgs/documents/document/ucm552166.pdf&quot;&gt;strongly worded letter&lt;/a&gt; tellling Hyland to issue an immediate recall of the two products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In October, FDA officials released an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm523468.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt; recommending parents not give their children homeopathic teething tablets or gels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tablets and gels are sold online as well as in some stores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hyland’s, which says it has the best-selling brand of teething tablets, told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/05/health/fda-teething-tablets-warning/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; at the timie that it stands by its product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CVS pharmacies, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cvshealth.com/newsroom/press-releases/cvs-pharmacy-announces-voluntary-withdrawal-homeopathic-teething-products&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; they had pulled from its shelves the Hyland’s products as well as their own versions and those made by Baby Orajel Naturals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FDA recommended parents stop using these products and throw away any they have in their home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Teething can be managed without prescription or over-the-counter remedies,” said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a press release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The advisory was made after parents reported their children were experiencing seizures, having difficulty breathing, and displaying lethargy, among other symptoms, after taking the homeopathic products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FDA officials said they are investigating the incidents. They added the homeopathic tablets and gels have not been evaluated for safety or efficacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not the first advisory the FDA has made against homeopathic teething tablets. In 2010, the FDA released another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm230761.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advisory&lt;/a&gt;. This one specifically named the brand Hyland’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teething tablets are meant to treat the symptoms that babies experience when their first sets of teeth come in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Homeopathic tablets contain diluted versions of natural substances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hyland’s teething tablets contain belladonna.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Belladonna concerns&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Belladonna is a nightshade plant. It’s been used to treat tremors and spasms — symptoms caused by conditions such as colitis and Parkinson’s disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, belladonna also has the potential to be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. David Krol, the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Oral Health, says “There isn’t really a use for it in children and … it can have significant side effects.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361210/#CIT0004&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that children can overdose on belladonna after ingesting the equivalent of only two or three of the berries. This makes it important that dosage is monitored carefully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 2010 FDA advisory stated that Hyland’s tablets did not have a consistent amount of belladonna in each tablet. This made it more likely that infants would overdose on the tablets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company issued a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm230764.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recall&lt;/a&gt; and a new tablet was introduced in 2011.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Teething symptoms&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difficulty with soothing a baby’s symptoms while they’re teething is that there isn’t much research to support what does and doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, Krol says that there aren’t typical symptoms associated with teething.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Many people will assume that if a child is drooling a lot, if they’re fussy, if they’re crying, if they have any array of symptoms that it can be attributed to teething,” he told Healthline. “But the literature tells us that it’s hard to tie any of those things directly to teething. They can be caused by a variety of other things.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These behaviors are also typical of 6-month-old infants, whether they’re teething or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, diarrhea, vomiting, and fever are never symptoms of teething. These symptoms can be caused by more serious conditions. And because they can quickly become very serious for infants, parents should call a doctor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Managing teething&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infants who are teething are old enough for other medications such as ibuprofen (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Krol says parents should avoid using any type of medication if they think their child has teething symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When balancing both the science as well as the risk I err on not encouraging any medications for teething,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When parents give medications to infants, there’s always a risk that the infant absorbs too much. Instead, Krol recommends that parents be soothing and loving to a child that is having trouble with teething. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a child has sore gums, parents can freeze teething rings. He also suggests parents freeze a wet washcloth, wrap it around their finger, and rub it on the child’s gums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

eople with melanoma who develop vitiligo – a condition characterized by white patches of skin – often have a better prognosis than those without vitiligo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research finds that this may be due to a greater abundance of cancer-fighting memory T cells in their skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That discovery could lead to new treatments for melanoma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mary Jo Turk, Ph.D., of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire and a study leader, and her colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.aam6346&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; their findings today in the journal Science Immunology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The characteristics of melanoma&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Melanoma is a cancer that begins in skin cells called melanocytes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cells are responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that protects the deeper skin layers from the damaging effects of sun exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While melanoma is not the most common skin cancer in the United States, it is one of the deadliest. This year, it is estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/cancer/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9,730 people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. will die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3248219/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that people with metastatic melanoma – that is, melanoma that has spread to other areas of the body – may survive for longer if they also have vitiligo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitiligo is a skin disorder that researchers believe is triggered by an immune system attack on melanocytes, which causes white patches to appear on the skin and particularly on the face, lips, arms, hands, and feet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For their study, Turk and colleagues set out to determine why vitiligo seems to improve the prognosis of patients with melanoma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cancer-fighting T cell discovery&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers came to their findings by analyzing the skin of mouse models with vitiligo and melanoma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team found that skin affected by vitiligo consists of resident memory T cells, which are immune cells that provide an initial response against infection in tissue surfaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While resident memory T cells are known to prevent viral infections in skin, the researchers were surprised to find that they also have cancer-fighting abilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turk and colleagues note that cancer-fighting T cells were thought to only be present in the blood, the spleen, lymph nodes, and other immune system organs, and that they launch an attack on foreign invaders by entering the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Our studies challenge this long-held belief by showing that tumor-killing T cells already reside in skin, where they can rapidly respond and kill melanoma cells,” says Turk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although this study was conducted in mouse models, the researchers believe that their findings may help to explain why vitiligo appears to extend the life of patients with melanoma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next step for Turk and colleagues is human studies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;While we have shown that these T cells can kill melanoma in skin, we still need to determine whether they exist in other organs such as lung, where metastatic melanoma grows,” says Turk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hope is that their findings will pave the way for new treatments for melanoma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Since our study identifies that resident memory T cells are critical for protection against tumors, and that T cells in skin provide long-term immunity to melanoma, the generation of such cells should be the goal of future cancer therapies,” Turk adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

That is why it is sometimes referred to as a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/kidney-disease-statistics-united-states.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;silent disease&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is estimated that as many as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kidneyfund.org/assets/pdf/kidney-disease-statistics.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9 out of 10&lt;/a&gt; people with moderately reduced kidney function do not know that they have kidney disease.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The impact of the disease is sizable, however.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) estimates that chronic kidney disease occurs in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/kidney-disease-statistics-united-states.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;14 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the U.S. population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, more than 660,000 people in the country have kidney failure. In 2013, more than 47,000 people died of kidney disease in the United States. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is known that people with chronic kidney disease are also at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the NIDDK, almost 70 percent of people aged 66 and above who have chronic kidney disease also have cardiovascular disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this context, an international team of researchers led by Dr. Bernadette Thomas from the University of Washington in Seattle investigated the prevalence of kidney disease in relation to cardiovascular-related deaths at six points in time between 1990 and 2013.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newswise.com/articles/kidney-disease-is-a-major-cause-of-cardiovascular-deaths&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; were published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cardiovascular vs. kidney failure deaths&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, Thomas and team looked at kidney disease stages 3, 4, and 5, examining their prevalence in 188 countries that were included in the Global Burden of Disease Study. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the NIDDK, there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/Pages/kidney-disease-statistics-united-states.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;five stages&lt;/a&gt; of chronic kidney disease, each corresponding to different degrees of kidney function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They range from normal kidney function (at stage 1) to kidney failure, at which point either dialysis or a kidney transplant is often needed for survival. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stages considered in the study correspond to a mild to severe loss of kidney function, severe loss of kidney function, and kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thomas and team estimate that worldwide, 2.2 million deaths in 2013 were linked to reduced kidney function. This amounts to 4 percent of the total number of deaths in that year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than half of these deaths (around 1.2 million) were cardiovascular and 960,000 deaths were caused by kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at how reduced kidney function ranked in comparison with metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease during the time period studied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They found that kidney disease fell behind high body mass index (BMI), high systolic blood pressure, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003482-cr-1.htm?utm_expid=.xOQ8bDlsQeGQ6XTTmPo6yQ.1&amp;amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;high fasting blood glucose&lt;/a&gt;, which is a marker of prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a risk factor for premature death, disability, and poor health, reduced kidney function was on par with high total cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was calculated using disability-adjusted life years (DALY) as a metric, and the results were valid for both developed and developing countries throughout the world. One &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/metrics_daly/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DALY&lt;/a&gt; refers to one year of life lost to poor health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thomas highlights the importance of the study for understanding the real effect that kidney disease has on cardiovascular health in various countries around the world. She also stresses the necessity of kidney disease screening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Understanding the true health impact of kidney disease on society necessitates considering cardiovascular as well as end-stage renal disease deaths and disability,” she said. “This is especially important within the developing world, where the death rate has increased since 1990.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

However, for women at average risk, the chance of cancer developing in the other breast is small.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the surgery &lt;a href=&quot;https://uihc.org/health-library/women-breast-cancer-considering-prophylactic-mastectomy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;has not been shown&lt;/a&gt; to help those women live longer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, why do they do it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Genetic testing &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As genetic testing becomes more common, we know more than ever about our health risks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations are associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers. Testing helps women understand the risks of developing specific types of cancer, as well as whether they can pass the mutations on to their children. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also helps in choosing treatment options or taking preventive measures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of those preventive measures is prophylactic mastectomy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For women who carry the BRCA mutations or have a strong family history of breast cancer, the surgery may reduce the risk of developing breast cancer by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/surgery/prophylactic_mast&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;90 to 95 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testing is one thing. Interpreting the results is another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2016.71.6480&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of more than 2,000 newly diagnosed women found that half who had a double mastectomy after genetic testing didn’t actually have mutations that increase the risk of additional cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They had variants of uncertain significance (VUS), which are often harmless.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About half the women who had genetic testing never spoke to a genetic counselor about the results. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between one-quarter and one-half of breast cancer surgeons surveyed said they treat women with VUS the same way they treat women with known cancer-associated mutations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some women have the surgery before they ever get the results. Or before being tested at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why they do it&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 45 years old, Charlotte Gajewski of Texas was diagnosed with stage 0 DCIS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It sounded simple enough,” she wrote in an email to Healthline. “But after two lumpectomies, they continued to find more positive margins with cancer cells speckled throughout my breast in a shotgun pattern.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She tested negative for the BRCA genetic mutations and had no family history of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;/health/breast-mri-scan&quot;&gt;MRI&lt;/a&gt; of the unaffected breast revealed a flat tumor. It was non-threatening but would need to be monitored. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So I elected to have a mastectomy and, ultimately, a bilateral mastectomy,” said Gajewski. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her doctor explained the pros and cons of the surgery. Her only hesitation was whether or not to spare the nipple on the unaffected breast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She chose radical mastectomy on both so she wouldn’t have to live with doubts and fears of recurrence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She’s happy with her decision but says she has no feeling or sensation across her entire chest, which is both annoying and a constant reminder of what she went through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What sounded like a simple and ‘dream’ diagnosis turned into quite a fiasco for me. But life is good now and I am healthy and joyful every day,” said Gajewski.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mari Gallion, 47, is an author living in Alaska. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following the diagnosis of &lt;a href=&quot;/health/triple-negative-breast-cancer-outlook-survival-rates-stage&quot;&gt;triple-negative breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;, her doctor suggested breast-conserving surgery in the affected breast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the first lumpectomy failed to get clear margins. The second, third, and fourth lumpectomies were also unsuccessful. It no longer made sense to keep trying to save the breast, even though she tested negative for BRCA mutations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Together with her surgeon, she decided on a double mastectomy despite having cancer in only one breast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most important consideration was her health, she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Early in the process, should mastectomy have become a reality, I was considering foregoing reconstruction when it was just one breast,” Gallion said. “My mom had a prosthetic, so I wasn't afraid of that, but if two were being removed, I wanted them both done.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gallion feels fortunate that she was able to have the mastectomy and immediate reconstruction without the need for tissue expanders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not that it was easy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She called the first four weeks after mastectomy “horrifying.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There were moments that I wished I hadn't opted for reconstruction because of the pain and the time off work,” she said. “I had six surgeries all together, one of them three weeks after the mastectomy to remove the nipple, as there was a positive margin on my nipple. I understand it can be just as painful without the reconstruction. I was concerned about taking too many opioids, as I was literally watching the clock to see when I was allowed to take another pill. However, I am extremely happy with the result.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They [my breasts] are kind of crazy looking in that one doesn't have a nipple, but I like that I can wear all my old clothes,” continued Gallion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She’s considering getting a 3-D tattoo in place of the missing nipple.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mastectomy despite not having breast cancer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Comedian Caitlin Brodnick has never been diagnosed with breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But she had a double mastectomy anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of her reasoning was based on her childhood. Her father’s entire immediate family died of various cancers, including breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Growing up, I was convinced I would get cancer. I was really afraid,” Brodnick told Healthline. “I was born just nine months after my aunt died of cancer. It was completely devastating and my whole family was anxious about health and cancer as a direct result.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 28 years old, she tested for BRCA mutations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The result was positive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To Brodnick, it felt like a cancer diagnosis. In fact, she refers to it as a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The official diagnosis and knowing I had the genetic mutation was scary. I thought it would be easier to have something you clearly knew how to fight. The idea that you’re more likely to get cancer is very vague. You have to continually test and see doctors for screening. You’re on the defense and it’s maddening. You don’t know if cancer is lurking around the corner,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brodnick credits actress Angelina Jolie with jumpstarting the preventive mastectomy conversation. Jolie, who carries the BRCA1 genetic mutation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/opinion/my-medical-choice.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went public&lt;/a&gt; following her preventive double mastectomy in 2013.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Doctors are cautious because they don’t want patients to have a mastectomy as a gut emotional response without thinking it through,” said Brodnick. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors didn’t push the decision on her.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She came to it on her own after discussing it with her husband and other family members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She’d never had a major surgery before, so there was a lot of pre-op anxiety. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The minute I woke up after surgery I felt total relief,” she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She also had implants. The size didn’t work out, so the procedure had to be repeated. Other than that, there haven’t been any post-surgical complications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I had no idea I’d feel this great. Three years later, I’m strong and healthy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As satisfied as she is with her own decisions, she knows it’s not for everyone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A close friend had breast cancer at a young age and had a mastectomy. It was traumatic for her. Reconstructed breasts won’t ever be like real breasts,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brodnick’s story is documented in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.glamour.com/series/screw-you-cancer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Screw You Cancer Series&lt;/a&gt; with Glamour magazine and her upcoming book, “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Dangerous-Boobies-Breaking-Time-Bomb-Breasts/dp/158005675X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dangerous Boobies: Breaking Up with My Time-Bomb Breasts&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A breast surgeon’s point of view&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Diane M. Radford is staff breast surgical oncologist at &lt;a href=&quot;https://my.clevelandclinic.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; and medical director of the breast program at Cleveland Clinic Hillcrest Hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When counseling patients with cancer in one breast, she follows the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breastsurgeons.org/docs/ASBrS_CPM_PositionStatement.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;consensus statement&lt;/a&gt; from the American Society of Breast Surgeons and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.breastsurgeons.org/new_layout/programs/choosing_wisely.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Choosing Wisely&lt;/a&gt; guidelines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I counsel women about the lack of survival benefit with CPM (contralateral prophylactic mastectomy) and increased risk of complications such as bleeding and infection,” she wrote in an email to Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In patients in high risk groups, such as BRCA gene carriers, the risk to the other breast is high enough to warrant CPM. My approach is evidence-based, and I review the pros and cons,” she said. “While CPM is the best risk reduction we can offer (about 95 percent risk reduction), the risk of cancer in the other breast is small in average risk women — 0.2 to 0.5 percent per year for those undergoing adjuvant therapies.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No surgery is risk-free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The risk of bleeding is about 1 percent and the risk of infection is also about 1 percent,” said Radford. “So if both breasts are removed those risks rise to 2 percent and 2 percent. There is debate on whether to routinely perform sentient node biopsy for CPM. I do not routinely perform sentient node biopsy for CPM, therefore there is theoretically no risk of &lt;a href=&quot;/health/lymphatic-obstruction#overview1&quot;&gt;lymphedema&lt;/a&gt; with CPM.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medical decisions often involve more than statistics and probabilities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s also a quality of life issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Radford explained that if, after counseling, a woman at average risk for contralateral cancer wishes CPM, she would agree to do it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The consensus statement states that CPM also may be appropriate for women with other conditions such as dense breasts, recall fatigue, concern about reconstruction symmetry, and extreme disease-related anxiety,” she said. “If in my opinion the patient will be extremely anxious about risk to the other breast, then for quality of life, I would perform CPM.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The medical community is making efforts to include men in breast cancer studies unless there’s a biological or scientific reason to exclude them. But even if you do include them, you can imagine how few of them would be in the study.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Diagnosis, risk factors&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genetics doesn’t play a big role in breast cancer in women, but it does in men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In women, the risk factor for developing breast cancer is that you’re a woman and you’re getting older,” said Ramaswamy. “So age and being a woman are the most important risk factors for women. People often ask about family history and whether you carry the gene and things like that, and the risk factor of carrying an inheritable gene mutation is only between five to 10 percent in females.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For men, the risk factors are completely different, says Ramaswamy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The most common reason for men to develop breast cancer is not aging, and it’s not because they’re men. It’s carrying the genetic mutation,” she said. “The risk factor difference is flipped because the most common reason for a man to develop breast cancer is because he carries the gene mutation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ramaswamy also points out that more than 90 percent of breast cancers in men are of the estrogen receptor positive subtype, while that number falls to about 70 percent in women. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This means that more than 90 percent of breast cancers in men are dependent on estrogen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Male breast cancer is largely a fluke, but are there any preventative measures men can take?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You can’t modify a gene and you can’t modify your family history, obviously,” said Ramaswamy. “But you can modify your lifestyle. Men have an increased risk of developing breast cancer if they are overweight and if they drink. Because both obesity and alcohol consumption lead to higher estrogen in the body.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A lonely battle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Breast cancer tends to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States, so there is no shortage of support options for women diagnosed with the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But for men, finding support can be difficult.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The emotional aspect is so different between the two groups and I think this is something that’s important to highlight,” said Ramaswamy. “If a man is diagnosed, he’ll often feel very isolated. Almost all of my male breast cancer patients have verbalized that they feel isolated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also a stigma many of the men feel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some of them also feel a little bit, kind of shameful, to share with their friends that they have breast cancer,” Ramaswamy added. “It’s not as masculine as saying that they have prostate cancer. There are also lots of concerns about taking medications like estrogen pills and how that will affect the idea of being a man.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men also can have problems finding information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The interesting, or ironic, part of this is that there is so much information, so much constantly being said about breast cancer on the web and everywhere else — but it isn’t about their specific problem,” Ramaswamy added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Outcomes largely the same&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the unique challenges that breast cancer presents in men, treatment of the disease is pretty much the same for men and women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Stage for stage, the outcomes are no different for male and female breast cancer,” said Ramaswamy. “So if you compare them at the same stages and types and subtypes, the outcomes are pretty much the same.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is relatively good news for men who are diagnosed as they can utilize the same treatment methods as women — and, increasingly, the same medications as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But because the disease is so rare in men, detection can be difficult. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is some data that male breast cancers are diagnosed a little bit late because men are not doing self-exams or getting mammograms, so there is some data on delayed diagnosis of male breast cancer,” said Ramaswamy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added that since 99 percent of breast cancers occur in women, treatment and support services will always necessarily be geared toward women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s definitely a very unique situation for men with breast cancer,” said Ramaswamy. “It’s not that there’s an agenda on this. It’s just that women are far more likely to develop breast cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
rates among middle-aged white Americans have risen dramatically since 1999, especially for those with low levels of education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two Princeton University economists say this is driven mainly by deaths due to drug overdoses, suicide, and liver diseases related to alcohol — what they call “deaths of despair.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In particular, this group of Americans has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic — both from prescription and illegal opioids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This has led to midlife mortality rates for working class Americans overtaking those of minority groups for the first time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/mortality-and-morbidity-in-the-21st-century/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;, Princeton University’s Angus Deaton and Anne Case suggest that a “cumulative disadvantage” has kept middle-aged whites in a downward spiral since the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, we see our story as about the collapse of the white, high school educated, working class after its heyday in the early 1970s, and the pathologies that accompany that decline,” they write in the report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rising mortality rates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rising mortality rates among middle-aged whites are unusual in that they follow a century of declining rates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trend is also unique to this segment of the population. Since 1999, Americans in other groups — based on age, race, or ethnicity — have all experienced improvements in mortality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deaths rates among middle-aged whites with less than a high school degree are rising the quickest and much faster than middle-aged whites with at least a four-year college degree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2016/12/17/505965420/study-communities-most-affected-by-opioid-epidemic-also-voted-for-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Recent news reports&lt;/a&gt; sometimes focus on the impact of “deaths of despair” in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Case and Deaton found that these conditions are now much more widespread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2000, the “deaths of despair” epidemic among whites was centered in the Southwest. By the mid-2000s, it had spread to Appalachia, Florida, and the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it pervades all areas of the country, both rural and urban.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Middle-aged whites have also lost ground against heart disease, with declines in mortality slowing over the past decade and even stopping recently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some blame the slowing progress against heart disease on the obesity epidemic. But it is not that simple.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Case and Deaton write that obesity is rising faster among African-Americans than whites. In spite of that, African-Americans made more progress against heart disease between 1999 and 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that some deaths attributed to heart disease may actually be due to type 2 diabetes, which is also associated with obesity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cumulative disadvantages in life&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the researchers focused on mortality rates since the late 1990s, they also pointed out longer trends for whites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rate of “deaths of despair” for whites born in 1975 is rising faster than for those born in 1935.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unemployment has also increased with each successive age group of whites since that time, while marriage rates have gone down. Self-reported physical pain and poor physical and mental health have gone up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers write that others have suggested that “slowly growing, stagnant, and even declining incomes” have contributed to the high mortality rates of middle-aged whites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, middle-aged African-Americans and Hispanics have fared little better in terms of income while their mortality has been falling over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The “cumulative disadvantage” in life faced by whites fits with some theories suggesting that a rise in “deaths of despair” is driven by an erosion of this group’s social and economic well-being over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s quite possible that some of the social adversities that middle-aged white men have been facing in the country over the last 20 years are having an impact on their health outcomes, including their use of substances and their vulnerability to poor outcomes,” Dr. Itai Danovitch, chair and associate professor of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Growing deaths of despair&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the circumstances faced by this group, “deaths of despair” may be an especially apt phrase for these preventable conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s probably an element of both alcohol and opioids that involves self-medicating,” said Danovitch. “And when you think about what self-medication is about, it’s often about trying to fill a hole or treat an emotional pain, or deal with despair.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These conditions also overlap, with each fueling and feeding on the others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Alcohol use is associated with increased suicides. And suicides are also associated with alcohol use. And mental health problems are common to all three of those conditions,” said Danovitch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Related mental health problems can happen not only when people are in the depths of a substance use disorder, but also when they are trying to “go straight.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Opioids and alcohol are really profound addictions that come with very difficult withdrawal symptoms — the kind of despair that is often associated with suicide,” Kevin Doyle, EdD, LPC, LSATP, a professor in the counselor education program at Longwood University in Virginia, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complicating the matter, people also vary in how they end up with a substance abuse disorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some people are depressed, and drugs and alcohol start out as a way to help them cope,” Deni Carise, PhD, chief clinical officer for Recovery Centers of America, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other people, she said, start using drugs and alcohol to have fun. And it becomes “such a problem that they’ve now either altered their brain chemistry so that they are depressed, or they are depressed situationally.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The effects of substance abuse can also spill over into other areas of a person’s life, feeding the sense of “despair.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With substance abuse, “there’s lots of family and financial ruin, involvement in the criminal justice system, etc.,” said Doyle, “the kinds of things that might cause someone to lose hope and get to that point of taking their own life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Opioid epidemic still growing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The opioid epidemic, in particular, is a strong push behind rising “deaths of despair” mortality rates for middle-aged whites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/epidemic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;six out of 10&lt;/a&gt; drug overdose deaths in the United States are due to opioids. Nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;half of these&lt;/a&gt; involve a prescription opioid, such as methadone, OxyContin, and Vicodin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This includes both intentional and unintentional overdoses. Not everyone who dies of an overdose is addicted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among people who died from a prescription opioid overdose between 1999 and 2014, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/overdose.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;overdose rates&lt;/a&gt; were higher among whites, American Indians and Alaskan Natives, compared to African-Americans and Hispanics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2612444&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Psychiatry also found that between 2001 and 2013, heroin use increased more in whites than in other racial and ethnic groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the proportion of people reporting that they started using prescription opioids for recreational purposes before moving onto heroin increased more for whites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a “gateway drug,” prescription opioids have been frighteningly effective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It used to be that by the time somebody comes into treatment for heroin problems, they have what we would call a 10- or 20-year drug use history or career,” said Carise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But now, people who try a prescription opioid pill at a party or lift one from a friend’s medicine cabinet, can quickly move onto heroin, methadone, or fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We have this very short trajectory now, that I’ve never seen in 30 years,” said Carise. “Sometimes in three, six, nine months easy, they’re using heroin because it’s easier to get, it’s stronger, and it’s less expensive.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the complex factors behind the rise in “deaths of despair” among whites, Case and Deaton write that it “will take many years to reverse the mortality and morbidity increase.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may not bode well for whites who are in midlife right now — they are “likely to do much worse in old age than those currently older than 65,” write the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Counteracting this epidemic will take a comprehensive public health approach, one that addresses both the economic and social factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It will also mean helping people before they reach middle age — maybe even as early as public school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We need to “empower people’s ability to recover when they hit adversity,” said Danovitch, “to be resilient, and to be healthy, and to have lives that have well-being and quality.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mental-health/082515_musictherapy_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the drumbeats of our ancient ancestors to today’s unlimited streaming services, music is an integral part of the human experience. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers have pondered the possible therapeutic and mood boosting benefits of music for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.musictherapy.org/about/history/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;centuries&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even sad music brings most listeners pleasure and comfort, according to recent research from Durham University in the United Kingdom and the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland, published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157444&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS ONE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conversely, the study found that for some people, sad music can cause negative feelings of profound grief. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research involved three surveys of more than 2,400 people in the United Kingdom and Finland, focusing on the emotions and memorable experiences associated with listening to sad songs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority of experiences reported by participants were positive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The results help us to pinpoint the ways people regulate their mood with the help of music, as well as how music rehabilitation and music therapy might tap into these processes of comfort, relief, and enjoyment,” said lead author, Tuomas Eerola, Ph.D., a professor of music cognition at Durham University, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=28329&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also said the study may help find reasons for both listening to and avoiding sad music. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An earlier study, published in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/670609?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Journal of Consumer Research&lt;/a&gt;, found that people tend to prefer sad music when they are experiencing a deep interpersonal loss, like the end of a relationship. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors of that study &lt;a href=&quot;http://press.uchicago.edu/pressReleases/2013/May/0515Lee.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that sad music provides a substitute for the lost relationship. They compared it to the preference most people have for an empathic friend — someone who truly understands what you’re going through. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other research has focused on the joy upbeat music can bring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2013 study in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2012.747000&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Journal of Positive Psychology&lt;/a&gt; found that people who listened to upbeat music could improve their moods and boost their happiness in just two weeks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the study, participants were instructed to try to improve their mood, but they only succeeded when they listened to the upbeat music of Copland as opposed to the sadder tunes of Stravinsky. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And a happier mood brings benefits beyond feeling good. In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://munews.missouri.edu/news-releases/2013/0514-trying-to-be-happier-works-when-listening-to-upbeat-music-according-to-mu-research/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, lead study author, Yuna Ferguson, noted that happiness has been linked to better physical health, higher income, and greater relationship satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Music as therapy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This music research aligns with the larger arena of music therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.musictherapy.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Music Therapy Association (AMTA)&lt;/a&gt; reports that music therapy programs can be designed to achieve goals such as managing stress, enhancing memory, and alleviating pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might seem surprising that music can help people cope with physical pain, but research has shown a clear link. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2015 review in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(15)60169-6/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that people who listened to music before, during, or after surgery experienced less pain and anxiety, compared to patients who did not listen to music. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The music listeners didn’t even need as much pain medication. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, researchers looked at data from 73 different trials, involving more than 7,000 patients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The people who experienced a slightly greater, but nonsignificant, reduction in pain, and needed the least pain medication, were the ones who got to pick their own music. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Music is a non-invasive, safe, cheap intervention that should be available to everyone undergoing surgery,” lead study author Catherine Meads, Ph.D., of Brunel University in the United Kingdom, recommended in a&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/tl-tll081115.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to treating chronic conditions, music therapy can also play a powerful role. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent review in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369551/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt; found that music therapy can be an effective treatment for mood disorders related to neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, dementia, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reviewing 25 trials, the researchers concluded that music is a valid therapy to potentially reduce depression and anxiety, as well as to improve mood, self-esteem, and quality of life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also noted that no negative side effects were reported in any of the trials, making music a low-risk treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Goldstein, a recording artist who has studied the vibrational effects of music for more than 25 years, says music has a profound impact on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/music-and-the-brain-affects-mood/&quot;&gt;a column&lt;/a&gt; for Conscious Lifestyle magazine, Goldstein wrote that music can actually enhance brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said music can evoke emotion, help regain memories, stimulate new neural connections, and active attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Boosting moods&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While listening to music may bring greater health benefits, creating it can be an effective therapy, too. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A unique orchestra for people with dementia helped improve their mood and boost their self-confidence, according to researchers at the Bournemouth University Dementia Institute (BUDI) in Dorset, U.K.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The orchestra is one of several BUDI research projects that aims to demonstrate how people with dementia can still learn new skills and have fun. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eight people with dementia and seven caregivers participated in the project, along with students and professional musicians. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Music touches everyone in some way, either by listening or playing,” said Anthea Innes, Ph.D., head of BUDI, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-events-and-publications/news/news-items/orchestra-helps-boost-confidence-and-mood-for-those-with-dementia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said that the orchestra has been a life-enhancing project for everyone involved, and that the project challenges the negative public perceptions of people diagnosed with dementia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Working together to produce a collaborative output is a powerful way to bring out the best in people — not just in terms of their musical skills, but their communication skills, friendships, care, and support for one another,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s 33 percent higher than metro regions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Finding a physician who can see you today, or three weeks from today, can be a challenge, even in large urban areas where there is a relatively robust supply of doctors,” Mark Smith, president of Merritt Hawkins, said in a press release. “The challenge becomes even more difficult in smaller communities that have fewer physicians per population.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also queried doctors on Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In metro areas, they found that 85 percent accept Medicare patients and 53 percent accept patients covered by Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In midsize regions, 81 percent of doctors accept Medicare patients, while 60 percent accept Medicaid patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why wait times are increasing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons for the increase in wait times is the simple law of supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kurt Mosley, vice president of strategic alliances for Merritt Hawkins, said the current and pending shortage of doctors is a prime cause of the increase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted this is particularly true in Boston, which had the highest average wait time with 52 days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fact of the matter is we simply don’t have enough doctors,” Mosley told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Mott Blair, a family physician in North Carolina, and a member of the board of directors of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said the increase in the number of patients is also exacerbating the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He told Healthline that more people have health insurance because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the uptick in the economy the past few years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is creating higher demand at doctors’ offices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As the economy has turned around, we have been seeing a lot more people who want care,” Blair said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mosley added that the growth in the number of people over the age of 55 is also increasing demand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both experts agreed that the introduction of electronic health records is also limiting the time doctors can spend with patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.physiciansfoundation.org/uploads/default/Biennial_Physician_Survey_2016.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another survey&lt;/a&gt; done last year by Merritt Hawkins, researchers discovered that 33 percent of doctors felt electronic records reduced the quality of care they give to patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, 55 percent said the electronic records reduced efficiency, and 59 percent said they reduced patient interaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Medical Association (AMA) found similar percentages in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ama-assn.org/study-technological-admin-demands-cut-face-time-patients&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a survey&lt;/a&gt; it did last fall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results prompted the AMA to issue &lt;a href=&quot;http://annals.org/aim/article/2546704/allocation-physician-time-ambulatory-practice-time-motion-study-4-specialties&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; in the Annals of Internal Medicine noting that for every hour physicians were spending with patients, they were spending two hours on electronic records and other administrative tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blair said all of these factors are producing a simple result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The number of patients I see during the day is decreasing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The ramifications of longer waits&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fallout from longer wait times is also varied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experts said people who have to wait several weeks to see a doctor might just skip routine or preventative medicine appointments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That can lead to consequences down the road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People can develop more serious ailments from ignoring symptoms or postponing healthcare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Healthcare delayed is healthcare denied,” said Mosley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other thing people do is make an appointment at an urgent care center or other medical facility when they can’t see their own doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blair said that’s fine if the patient is in pain or has a serious health issue. But, he said, if a person is going to a facility and seeing a different doctor each time for routine appointments they can miss out on the expertise a family doctor might contribute over a series of visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think this is a real danger,” he said. “It breaks down the continuity of care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

tific breakthroughs in brain-computer interface technology may offer new hope for overcoming paralysis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the latest advance, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/groundbreaking-technology-restores-movement-in-paralyzed-man/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;man with quadriplegia&lt;/a&gt; who was paralyzed eight years ago, regained functional movement of his arm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He fed himself with his hand using this technology, a first in medical history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio announced their findings on Mar. 28 in the British medical journal The Lancet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Case Western announcement was made the day after entrepreneur Elon Musk (of the Tesla electric car and rocket company SpaceX) revealed plans to develop a similar technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Musk’s “neural lace,” according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-launches-neuralink-to-connect-brains-with-computers-1490642652&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; in The Wall Street Journal, would link a person’s brain directly with a computer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, scientists at The Ohio State University (OSU) are working with a patient with paralysis and have developed a technology similar to the one at Case Western.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The OSU team is &lt;a href=&quot;http://osuwmc.multimedia-newsroom.com/index.php/2016/04/13/man-uses-his-own-brainwaves-to-retrain-his-paralyzed-hand/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;developing the technology&lt;/a&gt; with scientists at Battelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit organization in Ohio that creates medical devices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Decoding brain signals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Case Western scientists have been working with Bill Kochevar, a 53-year-old with quadriplegia who was injured in a bicycle accident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers implanted a neuroprosthesis that decoded his brain signals and transmitted them to sensors in his arm, which helped him to regain movement in his hand and arm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robert Kirsch, PhD, chair of the Case Western Department of Biomedical Engineering, executive director of the university’s Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) Center, is senior author of the research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He called the breakthrough a major step.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve shown the feasibility of recording someone’s movement intentions and then making their own arm make those movements,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kirsch’s colleague Bolu Ajiboye, PhD, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Case Western, and research associate at the Louis Stokes Cleveland Veterans Administration Medical Center, explained how the technology works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Normal movement in unimpaired persons occurs because the motor cortex generates a movement command, represented as electrical signals, that is passed through the spinal cord, and then activates the appropriate muscles,” Ajiboye told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spinal cord injury prevents those electrical impulses from reaching the muscles, he explained, but the original movement command is still properly coded in the brain's patterns of electrical activity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our system records the pattern of electrical activity through the brain implant and uses mathematical&amp;nbsp;algorithms to decode it into a movement command that is intended by the person with paralysis.&amp;nbsp;That command is converted into an electrical stimulation pattern that is applied to the right group of muscles to produce the movement. To Mr. Kochevar, the process is seamless and invisible. In his words, he says he just thinks about moving his arm and the arm moves as he intends.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ajiboye also pointed out what this new technology isn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Science has attempted many times to “fix” a damaged spine through tissue engineering and regrowth without success, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We would love for scientists to find a way to regrow and reconnect the spinal cord using cell therapies,” Ajiboye said. “However, our current approach uses technology to circumvent the spinal injury to get the movement signals from the brain to the right set of muscles to produce the movement.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other technologies that help people with paralysis to regain function are typically limited to devices they can control using their voices and eye movements, or by moving their heads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, none of these devices allow for control of one’s own limb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our device allows a user to move his own limb just by thinking,” Ajiboye explained. “I want to make it clear that our system is circumventing spinal injury, rather than reversing paralysis. Without the system, the user would still be paralyzed, and there is no evidence to suggest that use of this system would eventually result in the spinal regrowth, or would reintroduce the ability to move without the system.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How the technology works&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why is the Case Western technology unique?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The system is the first to use both a brain-implant computer interface with an FES system to electrically activate paralyzed muscles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prior to this, scientists have treated a number of people with paralysis but with only one approach or the other. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kochevar is the first person to experience this combined technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ajiboye said many research groups have used the brain interface system with humans and with nonhuman primates. Both test groups were able to perform tasks such as moving cursors on a computer screen or moving robotic arms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our FES Center for the last 25 to 30 years has implanted FES systems in people with spinal cord injuries to restore a number of functions, including standing, walking, breathing, and hand and arm movements,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kochevar joined the Case Western research project in 2014. He received his brain implants in December of that year. In 2015, Kirsch, Ajiboye, and their colleagues implanted electrodes in the muscles of his arm and hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kochevar learned to activate his brain signals to control different devices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We first had him watch a virtual arm move on a computer screen, while he simultaneously imagined making the same movements with his own arm,” Ajiboye said. “This generated patterns of neural activity. We then developed a neural decoder, a mathematical algorithm that related the generated patterns of neural activity with aspects of the virtual arm movements.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, they had Kochevar control the virtual arm by generating patterns of brain signals that were then interpreted by the neural decoder, Ajiboye said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kochevar trained to move the virtual arm with precision to specified targets in the workspace. The scientists quantified his brain control of the virtual arm, and discovered that he was able to control it almost immediately, Ajiboye said. In addition, Kochevar relatively quickly achieved a success rate of 95 to 100 percent of target accuracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, the scientists had Kochevar attempt to move his arm through FES stimulation in a two-step process. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We manually moved his arm (via electrical stimulation) and instructed him to imagine that he was in control of his arm movements,” Ajiboye said. “Again, this helped generate the desired patterns of neural activity, which we used to build and refine our neural decoder. We had him use the final neural decoder to command the movements of his own arm, reanimated through electrical stimulation. He was able to instantly move his arm as desired, and has progressively gotten better with increased use.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a video released by Case Western, Kochevar said, “It was amazing because I thought about moving my arm and it did. I could move it in and out, up and down.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since Kochevar had long-term paralysis, his muscles were initially weak and easily fatigued. Ajiboye said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To build his muscle strength and resistance to fatigue, the team “exercised” his muscles for several hours a day using electrical stimulation without the brain interface system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over time, this electrically stimulated exercise increased his muscle strength and his ability to use the system longer without fatigue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Brain-computer interfaces&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like the Case Western innovations, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://osuwmc.multimedia-newsroom.com/index.php/2016/04/13/man-uses-his-own-brainwaves-to-retrain-his-paralyzed-hand/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ohio State innovation&lt;/a&gt; helped a man with quadriplegia to use his hand after years of paralysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research team was led by Dr. Ali Rezai, a professor of neurosurgery and neuroscience, and director of the Center for Neuromodulation at the university’s Wexner Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The patient, Ian Burkhart, sustained a severe spinal cord injury at age 19 during a diving accident. It left him with little function and movement in his shoulders and biceps, and no movement from his elbows to his hands.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our team has developed a brain-computer interface technology that bypasses the damaged spinal cord, allowing a patient such as Ian with spinal cord injury and quadriplegia and no function of his hands for five years to simply use his thoughts to move his lifeless hand to come alive and under his volitional control,” Rezai told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In April 2014, Rezai implanted a microchip the size of the head of a pencil eraser on the surface of the motor cortex of Burkhart’s brain. The chip’s 96 microelectrodes recorded the firing of his individual neurons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rezai and his colleagues developed the neural bypass system, which records and analyzes the brain activity that occurs when Burkhart&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;intends to move his hand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After bypassing the damaged spinal cord and damaged connection from the brain to the muscle nerves, the system links Burkhart’s brain signal with an external garment sleeve, Rezai said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This enables Burkhart to move his hand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The brain implant records and interprets brain signals linked to thoughts, and links them to an external wearable sleeve garment to control his muscles,” Rezai explained. “It’s a neuromuscular stimulation system. The thoughts associated with an intention to move — for example opening the hand — are linked and connected within milliseconds to actual functional hand movement.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first generation of the external wearable sleeve garment and stimulation system, he said, has up to 160 stimulating electrodes “made up of super flexible hydrogel — a high-definition, high-resolution array of electrodes that conform to different shapes and contours such as the forearm.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The garment can be shaped into a sleeve, a glove, a sock, pants, belt, head-band, and other form factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Significant complexity and coordination is needed to allow movements in a smooth fashion to pick up a stirrer to stir the coffee, use a toothbrush, or play a video game,” he said. “This machine learning algorithm is improving and refining the movements from rough and choppy movements, to more smooth and fluid movements.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Optimism for the future&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists observing the recent breakthroughs are impressed and optimistic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joseph O’Doherty, PhD, a senior postdoctoral fellow at the Philip Sabes Lab at the University of California, San Francisco, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cin.ucsf.edu/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Center for Integrative Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;, calls these recent advances in brain-computer interface technology “groundbreaking.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This research shows that paralyzed limbs can be reanimated — by thought alone — for restoring the coordinated, multi-joint movements important for daily life: reaching, grasping, eating, and drinking,” he told Healthline. “It is a proof-of-principle demonstration that raises the possibility that similar therapies could soon find adoption outside of the clinic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists have been working on brain-computer interfaces, in some form or another, since the late 1960s, he said. The field has progressed from the control of computer cursors, to moving wheelchairs and robotic arms, to, now, reestablishing voluntary control over the limbs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Spinal cord injury often impairs the sense of touch as well as the ability to move,” O’Doherty said. “Restoring limb sensations will be a crucial element of neuroprostheses that permit fluid and natural movements.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are still many challenges to overcome,” he added, “but this new result, combined with many related advances in wireless technology, battery technology, materials science, and more, makes me very optimistic about neuroprosthetic devices for restoring movement and sensation becoming widely available.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rezai said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fscip.org/facts.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12,000 individuals&lt;/a&gt; in the United States each year sustain a spinal cord injury, and 300,000 live with such injuries from motor vehicle accidents, trauma, sports injuries, and falls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Less than 1 percent achieve full recovery, and most have deficits that rely on various assistive and adaptive technologies to provide a limited degree of independence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These innovations offer hope and the potential for movement restoration and increased independence to many patients living with paralysis or other physical disabilities,” Rezai said. “In addition to motor improvements, this technology has potential implications for those with sensory deficits, chronic pain, speech, stroke, cognitive, anxiety, and behavioral implications.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rezai said he is hopeful that soon those with physical, sensory, cognitive, and other disabilities will have the opportunity to be more functional, to have more independence, and a better quality of life.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make this technology less invasive, reduce the size of the device, miniaturize the sensors, make the system wireless, and provide the system at home instead of in the laboratory,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Case Western team is also working to advance its system technologically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need to develop a wireless brain interface to replace the cable that connects the user to a set of recording computers,” Ajiboye said. “We need to enhance the brain implant for longevity, to increase the number of neurons we can record from, and to develop a fully implanted brain interface and functional electrical stimulation system.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mens-health/041217_menhairdye_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the name of looking younger, men may be exposing themselves to dangerous amounts of lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response, a group of consumer advocacy organizations is taking legal action to help prevent that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ingredient at the center of the group’s concern is a compound called lead acetate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead acetate is a component in some “progressive” hair dyes, cosmetic products that are designed to gradually darken gray.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In February, several leading consumer groups, including the Environmental Defense Fund, Earthjustice, and the Environmental Working Group, filed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.edf.org/health/files/2017/02/Lead-Acetate-Color-Additive-Petition-02-04-17.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requesting the agency ban the use of lead acetate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The compound, which is found in Youthair and Grecian Formula products, is considered a neurotoxin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neurotoxins can damage organ systems, but they are particularly destructive to the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prolonged exposure to lead can result in brain damage, nerve damage, and neurological disorders, among other problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unborn babies, children, and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to the effects of lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/substances/toxsubstance.asp?toxid=22&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;labels lead acetate&lt;/a&gt; as a likely carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Banned in Europe, allowed in America&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FDA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/productsingredients/products/ucm143075.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; lead acetate for cosmetic use in 1980.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be approved as an additive, companies had to prove that lead acetate was safe under proper use circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the study phase, blood samples were drawn from people using the product and tested to monitor lead levels.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the FDA’s review of these findings, “no significant increase in blood levels of lead was seen in the trial subjects and the lead was not shown to be absorbed into the body through such use.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, in Canada and the European Union, the additive has been prohibited for almost a decade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In its decision to ban lead acetate, Health Canada wrote, “The results showed that relatively small incremental exposures, such as those which would occur with regular use of hair dyes containing lead acetate, could result in the accumulation of potentially harmful body burdens of lead.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, the compound remains legal in the United States, but hair products must print this warning to customers on the products’ boxes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Caution: Contains lead acetate. For external use only. Keep this product out of children's reach. Do not use on cut or abraded scalp. If skin irritation develops, discontinue use. Do not use to color mustaches, eyelashes, eyebrows, or hair on parts of the body other than the scalp. Do not get in eyes. Follow instructions carefully and wash hands thoroughly after use.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The problem with “proper use”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Progressive hair dyes need to be reapplied for proper maintenance of color.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That leads to continued exposure to the compound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plus, people don’t always follow the directions. Product packages advise people not to use these dye products on anything but their scalp, but not everyone heeds the warning. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2014 case study listed in the recent legal filing detailed the account of a man who had applied hair dye that contained lead acetate to his head and beard for seven months. He experienced tingling and numbness in his feet and hands, and his blood tests revealed the lead levels were 14 times higher than average blood lead levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His doctor recognized the neurotoxin in his hair dye and instructed him to stop using it. Once he ceased using the lead-containing product, levels of lead in his blood returned to normal within six months. His neurological symptoms were also gone within a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not just the men coloring their hair who are at risk of lead exposure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1997, researchers from Xavier University of Louisiana concluded that lead contamination extends to common surfaces. Men can transfer lead to faucets, handles, bottles, hair dryers, and more. Family members can easily pick up the traces of lead throughout the home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.japha.org/article/S0003-0465(15)32422-8/pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; states that the progressive hair dye products coat hands with 150 to 700 micrograms of lead per hand. And there were up to 100 micrograms of lead on the surfaces men touched.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Washing hands with soap and water does not completely remove the lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, running hands through the hair can also spread lead to the hands. Hand-to-mouth or hand-to-surface contamination is possible and likely quite common.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Regulators taking another look&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To put those numbers into context, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/lead/hazard-standards-lead-paint-dust-and-soil-tsca-section-403&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; that 40 micrograms of lead per square foot on the floor is considered hazardous to children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In countries where lead acetate is banned, brands like Grecian Formula and Youthair have created products that are lead-free. Some of those products are available in the United States, but the lead-containing products remain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In December, the FDA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocuments/ucm517327.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; limiting the amount of lead in certain cosmetic products, including lipstick, eye shadow, lotions, and more. Hair dyes, however, were not part of that list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FDA is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/04/04/2017-06581/environmental-defense-fund-earthjustice-environmental-working-group-center-for-environmental-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seeking comment&lt;/a&gt; from the public on the petition to ban lead acetate or allow it to remain an approved additive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the FDA were to ban the use of lead acetate in hair dyes and companies had lead-free alternatives available, the shift likely wouldn’t be a big market disruption. Still, manufacturers believe the ban would be an unnecessary restriction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Combe, the company that manufactures Grecian Formula, told CBS in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lead-acetate-hair-dye-mens-us-consumer-groups-file-petition-to-fda/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that research on hand-to-mouth transmission of lead is “insufficient” and “lead acetate has been used safely as a color additive in ‘progressive’ hair dye products for decades based on extensive scientific studies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
;&lt;p&gt;A law signed last month by Utah Governor, Gary Herbert, requires doctors to tell women seeking medical abortions that the procedure can be stopped midway through the process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health professionals say there are no medical grounds to make this claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women’s rights advocates say it’s just the latest effort by lawmakers to police women’s bodies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also say it’s part of a larger trend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abortion opponents haven’t been able to completely outlaw abortions, advocates say, so instead they are supporting laws across the country that make the medical procedure more difficult to obtain. Or they’re attempting to put in place requirements that interfere with the doctor-patient relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would tie this Utah law to a trend of abortion restrictions, a broader trend, that really seek to interfere directly in the exam room without necessarily banning abortion completely, but in even more nefarious ways,” Hayley Smith, a member of the Advocacy and Policy Counsel at the ACLU, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The law in Utah&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Utah &lt;a href=&quot;https://le.utah.gov/~2017/bills/static/HB0141.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://le.utah.gov/~2017/bills/static/HB0141.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;H.B. 141&lt;/a&gt;, is based on the premise that if a woman decided not to take a second &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/mifepristone/oral-tablet#Interactions3&quot;&gt;mifepristone&lt;/a&gt; pill — the drug that triggers a medical abortion — she could continue her pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Advocates for the bill say the legislation is backed by medical evidence, while doctors say it’s based on bunk science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m very much in favor of the Utah measure to inform women that medical abortions can be reversed,” Eric Scheidler, executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, told Healthline in an email. “And it’s simply not true that there is no medical evidence backing this up. I have personally spoken with physicians who have successfully halted medical abortions. They report that this treatment is successful 65 to 70 percent of the time it is employed, and no birth defects have been associated with it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medical professionals, meanwhile, are sounding a different tune.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acog.org/~/media/departments/state%20legislative%20activities/2015AZFactSheetMedicationAbortionReversalfinal.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement, “Claims of medication abortion reversal are not supported by the body of scientific evidence, and this approach is not recommended in ACOG’s clinical guidance on medication abortion. There are no ACOG guidelines that support this course of action.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The statement also noted that &lt;a href=&quot;/progesterone/oral-capsule#Highlights1&quot;&gt;progesterone&lt;/a&gt;, which is used in an effort to reverse the abortion, is “generally well tolerated” but can carry a host of adverse side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the bill has raised many concerns, it could have been worse, says Marina Lowe, a member of the Legislative and Policy Counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Utah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We saw this pop up pretty early in the session and we were obviously concerned,” she told Healthline. “The ACLU had experience with this same legislation when it was passed in Arizona a couple of years ago. There were some real concerns of the language, both from the perspective of mandating doctors to tell patients information which potentially is not medically accurate, but also some First Amendment issues.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lowe said her group sat down with the sponsor of the legislation and raised their concerns. The group ultimately provided the legislator with additional language that the ACLU thought would be better than the language that was in the bill originally. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While we still don’t support the bill and think it doesn’t make sense for legislators to be telling doctors what they need to tell their patients, this language is much more flexible in terms of giving doctors the space to tell patients what they believe is in their best interest,” Lowe said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Similar laws nationwide&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the Supreme Court’s landmark &lt;a href=&quot;http://landmarkcases.org/en/landmark/cases/roe_v_wade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Roe v. Wade ruling&lt;/a&gt; of 1973 guaranteed a woman’s right to seek abortion services, lawmakers around the country have found ways to make access to abortion difficult while not technically violating the ruling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith noted that in the first week of its legislative session, Kentucky legislators “sped through” a law that requires medical providers to perform an ultrasound prior to an abortion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The provider is required to show the image to the woman and describe it to her, even if she says she doesn’t want to hear that information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It really turns it into a coercive situation,” Smith said. “This is part of a broader trend: Commandeering the doctor-patient relationship and putting the state and politicians right into that relationship.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Oklahoma, the House Public Health Committee has &lt;a href=&quot;http://motto.time.com/4664160/oklahoma-abortion-written-consent/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;advanced&lt;/a&gt; a bill that would require women to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/319635-oklahoma-house-advances-bill-to-require-mens-permission-for-abortions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;written consent&lt;/a&gt; from their partner before getting an abortion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Arizona, Governor Doug Ducey, in late March, signed a bill into law that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mic.com/articles/172899/arizona-passes-extreme-abortion-restrictions-on-fetuses-that-are-delivered-alive#.3zKNSwqNn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;requires&lt;/a&gt; doctors to attempt to resuscitate aborted fetuses that are “&lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/04/arizona-governor-signs-restrictive-born-alive-abortion-law.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;born alive&lt;/a&gt;” — ambiguous language that’s up for interpretation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, multiple states require a mandatory “waiting period” for women seeking an abortion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lowe detailed some of the ways these laws limit a woman’s right to get an abortion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here in Utah, we have a 72-hour waiting requirement, whereby women who are seeking an abortion must wait 72 hours after being counseled and expressing their desire to get an abortion. They then must wait this 72-hour period to, quote, ‘think about their decision,’” Lowe said. “This may not sound like a big problem for some people, but if you live in a corner of the state of Utah, that 72-hour requirement means two separate trips to drive up to the part of the state where abortion clinics are located. If you have a family and a job and children, those two trips make it really quite difficult to access services you have a constitutional right to make use of.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tough for doctors&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Laws that compel doctors to say things that they don’t necessarily believe has the potential to raise ethical issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s really concerning,” Terry O’Neill, president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), told Healthline. “Medical doctors are first introduced to do no harm. Informed consent is incredibly important. Any patient, male or female, is entitled to having the informed, medically accurate medical science told to them about their condition, their prognosis, and their recommended treatments.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With abortion services, O’Neill said, that bond is being broken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Only in the case of women have we repeatedly seen ideological politicians inserting themselves into that informed consent process,” she said. “The law in Utah is a classic example. It actually requires doctors to lie to their patients. It is the antithesis of the informed consent that consumer groups have worked very, very hard to establish as the norm in medicine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lowe points out that laws like these could dissuade top doctors from practicing in a given state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This has an effect not only on women seeking abortions, but also physicians who are deciding whether or not to go into this field,” she said. “When your practice has made you feel shameful, when there are more requirements placed on you in terms or what you need to do in order to be licensed, in order to practice, when we see legislatures like the Utah legislature pushing these requirements that are essentially telling you to give your patients information that you don’t feel is accurate or safe or in the best interest of your patients, it has an effect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tougher for women&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scheidler defends the new laws on moral grounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Pro-Life Action League opposes abortion because it takes the life of an innocent unborn child, a child who is a member of the human family with an inalienable right to life, regardless of the circumstances surrounding the conception of that child,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Advocates for women, meanwhile, say that this position tramples on a woman’s right to make decisions about her body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think you’ll hear anti-abortion politicians say that they’re passing these bills to make sure that a woman has fully thought through her decision, which is demeaning to women,” says Smith. “Because the truth is that women do truly think through their decision, and they speak with their healthcare provider, they speak with their family, they speak with a trusted religious adviser if they have one. And they make that personal decision on their own. For a politician to come in and presume to know better is just wrong.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith suggests the laws have other motivations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think their ultimate goal is to stigmatize abortion and shame women for the decision that they’ve already made,” she said. “It’s just another means of blocking women from getting the care that they need.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This sustained effort to sustain and stigmatize women for having an abortion, it actually doesn’t work,” said O’Neill. “There have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128832#sec013&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; done that show that 95 percent of women absolutely do not regret their abortion and report that they believe they made the right decision. That is notwithstanding a sustained effort by extremely well-funded, very powerful groups.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sex ed. falls short&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While lawmakers in some states take a hands-on approach to regulating abortion, sexual education is often lacking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you really want to prevent abortions, the best way is to make sure that people have access to education and information in order to make the appropriate, medically accurate decisions about their bodies,” said Lowe. “In Utah, we do a terrible job of equipping our young people with that information.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said even some parents would prefer children be taught about sex education in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“From what we can tell, there are lots and lots of parents who are uncomfortable having these sorts of conversations with their kids and would prefer to have this sort of information provided in our schools,” Lowe added. “And yet our schools are deciding, because of our lawmakers, to not touch these topics either.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On this topic, both sides are able to find a small amount of common ground.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Pro-Life Action League does not support so-called ‘comprehensive’ sex education, which is often nothing more than training in condom use, along with the tacit message that we do not expect young people to be capable of exercising sexual self-control,” said Scheidler. “Truly comprehensive sex ed. would include training in understanding and recognizing the signs of a woman’s fertility cycle, and how to cooperate with that cycle to postpone pregnancy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Abortion debate affects everyone&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Statistics show that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.1in3campaign.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1 in 3 American women&lt;/a&gt; will have an abortion by the age of 45, meaning that statistically, most people know someone who has undergone an abortion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Regardless of a person’s personal beliefs about abortion, everyone has friends who are women, colleagues who are women, and women in their family,” said Smith. “The fact is that one in three women will have an abortion, so we all probably know someone who’s had one. It’s us. It’s our colleagues, our friends, our family members. And we can’t make that decision for somebody else, so I think the greatest thing is to think about these women, and think about what this means for their lives.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s extremely important that we stop demonizing women who have had abortions,” added O’Neill. “If we can reverse that, then politicians would no longer find it profitable to promote policies that end up harming women.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To gain a better understanding of the issue, O’Neill says it’s best to listen to women who have had abortions and are willing to share their experiences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As a practical matter, what I have seen in my experience is that women who talk about their abortion, to other men and women who are open minded, it does change the conversation,” she said. “It can change the opinion of the people who thought somehow that being anti-abortion was the same thing as being pro-life. They say, ‘Wait a minute, I can be pro-life and still support my friend who had an abortion. I can be there for her.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Artificial Sweeteners May Encourage Fat Production</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/food-fads/041117_sweetner_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more Americans turn to artificial sweeteners to reduce their sugar consumption, scientists are beginning to explore how the substitutes react in the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/672280/?sc=dwhr&amp;amp;xy=10020406&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; unveiled last week concluded that some artificial sweeteners may hinder our metabolism, rather than ramp it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is particularly true in people who are already obese. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the new study, researchers tested how sucralose reacted in human stem cells that can change into fat, muscle, bone, or cartilage cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists placed sucralose-saturated cells in petri dishes with substances that promote fat production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After 12 days, the cells — which held the amount of artificial sweetener equal to about four cans of soda — showed an increase in fat production from these genes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What researchers discovered&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study’s principal author is Dr. Sabyasachi Sen, an associate professor of medicine and endocrinology at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the results from the petri dish were tallied, Sen and his researchers conducted further assessments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They analyzed samples of abdominal fat from eight people who said they consumed artificial sweeteners, mostly sucralose, traces of aspartame, or acesulfame potassium. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Half of the samples came from people who were at a healthy weight while the other half came from people considered obese.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Sen, researchers saw evidence of increased glucose in abdomen fat cells and ramped up fat-producing genes in those who were obese.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other people who didn’t consume artificial sweeteners didn’t produce the same results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report also revealed that people who consumed low-calorie sweeteners — which can be seven times sweeter than regular sugar — showed an “overexpression” of sweet taste receptors in their fat cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That rate was almost three times higher in people with a history of artificial sweetener consumption than compared with people who didn’t consume the sugar substitute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Many health-conscious individuals like to consume low-calorie sweeteners as an alternative to sugar. However, there is increasing scientific evidence that these sweeteners promote metabolic dysfunction,” Sen said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings appear to run contrary to what many Americans believe, according to Dana Hunnes, PhD, MPH, RD, senior dietitian and adjunct assistant professor in the Fielding School of Public Health at the Ronald Reagan University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consuming artificial sweeteners in place of real sugar can help some people lose weight, but it may have a hidden downside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we really yet know the extent of what artificial sweeteners are doing to our bodies,” Hunnes told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Popularity of artificial sweeteners&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More Americans are using artificial sweeteners than ever before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study published earlier this year revealed that artificial sugar consumption among adults is up by &lt;a href=&quot;http://thatsugarfilm.com/blog/2017/01/29/artificial-sweetener-consumption-is-on-the-rise/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;54 percent&lt;/a&gt;. In children, it’s up by &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/children-consuming-more-artificial-sweeteners#1&quot;&gt;200 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health experts say the reason is because artificial sweeteners can be found in products that line grocery store aisles — from beverages, to popcorn, and even English muffins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Food labels that use the words “light” or “reduced sugar” often carry some type of artificial sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s everywhere,” Hunnes said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are currently about seven types of artificial sweeteners on the market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sucralose is considered one of the most popular. When the product was first introduced, it was marketed as a safe alternative, according to Hunnes, because it’s made from sugar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, food companies have added artificial sweeteners to their products as a way to provide low-calorie foods without sacrificing taste. And people are gobbling it up, according to Hunnes, because “people think it’s safe.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What latest research indicates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sen’s research, although utilizing a small sample size, is telling, according to Hunnes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It supports the hypothesis that increased consumption of artificial sweeteners may lead to weight gain and diabetes, as other studies have pointed out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23364017&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt; showed an increased risk in type 2 diabetes in people who consume diet beverages that had artificial sweeteners in their ingredients’ lists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, further experiments are needed, Hunnes added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, she’d like to see a randomized controlled trial, that’s also longitudinal, be conducted. Only then will scientists — and ultimately consumers — know the true facts about artificial sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a disconnect between what people believe vs. what science may actually be discovering,” she said. “They are replacing all this sugar with false sweetness and not doing themselves any favors.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until that happens, it’s still too soon to tell if artificial sweeteners will follow the same trajectory as margarine, she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For years, consumers were told that margarine was a safe and healthy alternative to butter because it didn’t contain saturated fats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/butter-vs-margarine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;scientists discovered&lt;/a&gt; that the types of trans fats found in margarine were worse than saturated fats in terms of causing heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Fresh Fruit Beneficial for People with Diabetes, Researchers Say

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/Diabetes/041117_fruitdiabetes_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does an apple a day keep the doctor away — even for people with diabetes?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002279&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in PLOS Medicine concludes that not only does fresh fruit help prevent diabetes, it also lowers risk of death and vascular complications for those already living with the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is the first large prospective study demonstrating similar inverse associations of fruit consumption with both incident diabetes and diabetic complications,” the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Half-million people studied&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between June 2004 and July 2008, researchers recruited half a million adults aged 30 to 79 throughout different regions of China to take part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants answered questionnaires and had their health monitored over the four-year period, allowing researchers to investigate links between diet and health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Among individuals who were free of diabetes at the start of the study,” the researchers wrote, “daily consumption of fresh fruit was associated with a 12 percent lower relative risk of developing diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those diagnosed with diabetes before the start of the study, eating fresh fruit more than three days a week produced a 17 percent lower risk of death from any cause.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The diet also produced a 13 to 28 percent decrease in risk of developing major complications from the disease such as heart disease and stroke, compared with individuals who didn’t consume as much fresh fruit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The sugar content in fruit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sugar content in fruit can be high.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, a cup of figs can have up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/high-low-sugar-fruits/slide/4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;27 grams of sugar&lt;/a&gt;, while a cup of grapes can have 16 grams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, medical opinion on fruit and diabetes has been mixed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study authors point out that previous medical literature shows contradictory conclusions. One study concluded that “higher fruit consumption was significantly associated with diabetes incidence.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A separate European study concluded that there was no association between the two.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, a recent meta-analysis of the issue said that higher fruit consumption was actually associated with a lower risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Different definitions of fruit&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can be perplexing, but there are reasons for the confusion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diets vary across the globe. That means the role — and even the definition — of fruit can change from place to place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors note that many earlier studies were primarily conducted with Western populations, where fresh fruit consumption was often combined with processed fruit (think canned peaches).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Processed fruit can also include fruit juices, which have been shown to be a risk factor for diabetes. In fact, because of its sugar content — which is comparable to soda pop — even “100 percent” fruit juice is linked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/23/health/fruit-juice-weight-gain-kids-study/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weight gain and obesity&lt;/a&gt;, especially in children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/29/whole-fruit-juice-diabetes-risk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported by The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; in 2013, said that individuals who replaced fruit juice with fresh fruit were able to significantly lower their risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Current &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.choosemyplate.gov/fruit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;USDA guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend 1.5 to 2 cups of fruit per day for adult men and women in the United States. However, the recommendations do not specifically say “fresh fruit” — fruit juices, dried fruit, and processed fruits can also be included.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Important distinction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nutritionist Kristin Kirkpatrick told Healthline that the difference between fresh fruit and refined sugars comes down to one important thing: fiber.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When eating fresh fruit, sugar is attached to fiber and, “that makes a big difference in how aggressive the body responds to the carbohydrate.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under USDA guidelines, a cup of juice is equivalent to a cup of fresh fruit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In healthy individuals that may be OK, but for people at risk for diabetes and obesity, comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has its own guidelines for fruit consumption, separate from the USDA. When contacted by Healthline, ADA officials pointed to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://professional.diabetes.org/sites/professional.diabetes.org/files/media/dc_40_s1_final.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2017 version&lt;/a&gt; of their publication Standards of Medical Care In Diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As for all Americans, individuals with diabetes should be encouraged to replace refined carbohydrates and added sugars with whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and fruits,” the association wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the ADA also does not make a significant distinction between the consumption of fresh and processed fruit as long as the final product doesn’t contain too much extra sugar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/making-healthy-food-choices/fruits.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, fresh, frozen, and canned fruit are in the same category, and even fruits in “light syrup,” are included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you pay top dollar for a good or a service, it’s reasonable to expect the best. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United States spends more per capita on healthcare than any other country in the world, amounting to more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$3 trillion&lt;/a&gt;, or about one-sixth of the country’s economy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But despite the high price tag, the United States is still the only wealthy, developed nation without universal health coverage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, as congressional Republicans &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/conservatives-outside-congress-say-latest-health-care-reform-push-has-foundered/2017/04/05/01435d36-1a11-11e7-855e-4824bbb5d748_story.html?utm_term=.8e23dd618f79&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;remain divided&lt;/a&gt; over healthcare reform, the issue of universal health coverage is getting renewed attention on both sides of the political spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has repeated calls for a &lt;a href=&quot;https://berniesanders.com/medicareforall/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medicare for All&lt;/a&gt; program that would provide health coverage for people of all ages, while gradually replacing the for-profit insurance industry. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If every major country on Earth guarantees healthcare to all people, and costs a fraction per capita of what we spend, don’t tell me that in the United States of America, we cannot do that,” Sanders said at a Boston rally in March.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sanders has put forward similar proposals before, in the Senate and as a nominee for Democratic Party leadership. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More surprising are the prominent conservative voices advocating for some form of universal coverage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsmax.com/ChristopherRuddy/trump-healthcare-health-paul-ryan/2017/03/14/id/778568/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; last month, Christopher Ruddy, chief executive officer of the conservative site Newsmax, and an ally of President Donald Trump, called for “an upgraded Medicaid system to become the country’s blanket insurer for the uninsured.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few days later, conservative writer Ross Douthat devoted his New York Times&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/18/opinion/sunday/make-america-singapore.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fross-douthat&amp;amp;action=click&amp;amp;contentCollection=opinion&amp;amp;region=stream&amp;amp;module=stream_unit&amp;amp;version=latest&amp;amp;contentPlacement=1&amp;amp;pgtype=collection&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;column&lt;/a&gt; to pondering how to make U.S. healthcare more like Singapore’s low-cost universal system, though he thinks it’s implausible.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Republicans continue to disagree over plans for health reform, discussion about the possibility of a universal system for the United States may grow. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The political divide&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) — commonly known as Obamacare — was enacted, Republicans have vowed to repeal it, but last month the party was too divided to move forward with a House vote on their replacement bill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That bill, the American Health Care Act (AHCA) — sometimes called Ryancare or Trumpcare —would have repealed major parts of the ACA, including the individual mandate that requires people who don’t buy insurance to pay a fine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also would have phased out the ACA’s expansion of Medicaid and allowed insurers to charge older adults higher premiums than younger people.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52486&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill would have left 24 million Americans uninsured within the next decade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main disagreement that stalled the bill was between the GOP’s far-right conservatives, who want to get rid of as much of the ACA as possible, and moderate Republicans, who want to ensure their constituents don’t lose health insurance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans, particularly for low-to-moderate income and older individuals,” said Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., co-chair of a moderate Republican caucus called the Tuesday Group, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://dent.house.gov/index.cfm?p=PressReleases&amp;amp;ContentRecord_id=C5448A50-4F80-4998-9416-62D80686F256&amp;amp;ContentType_id=C6EC3657-DC1E-476F-8D55-369892A8B74D&amp;amp;Group_id=7a83093f-b0df-4c08-affb-9f5cf4ef7c2a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Political blog FiveThirtyEight’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gops-new-health-care-plan-is-doomed-without-moderate-republicans/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; showed that it would be impossible for the Trump administration to get enough votes for the bill to pass the House without support from moderate Republicans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four Republican senators also sent a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gardner.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/gop-senators-say-house-health-care-draft-lacks-key-protections-for-medicaid-expansion-population&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicating they would not support the plan to phase out the ACA’s Medicaid expansion because “reform should not come at the cost of disruption in access to healthcare for our country’s most vulnerable and sickest individuals.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s those types of statements that fuel speculation — in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/opinion/republicans-for-single-payer-health-care.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, for example —that the Trump administration might have more success in reforming healthcare by embracing a universal system that covers everyone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is universal healthcare? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The terms “universal” and “single-payer” are sometimes confused when it comes to healthcare — but they are not the same thing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Universal health coverage is a broad term meaning that everyone has “access to good quality health services without suffering financial hardship,” according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/universal-health-coverage.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are at least two major types of universal health coverage, explained William Hsiao, PhD, a health economist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has designed universal healthcare systems in Taiwan, Sweden, and Malaysia, among others.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is the “National Health Service” model, used in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is a single-payer system because it is tax-funded and most healthcare is provided by the government through public hospitals and clinics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs operates in a similar way.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other type is the “National Health Insurance” model, in which the government mandates that everyone have health insurance, but services are delivered by a mix of public, nonprofit, and for-profit providers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within this second model, a range of different systems exists worldwide — some are single-payer, but others are multi-payer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Canada’s healthcare system and the U.S. Medicare system are single-payer. Everyone is required to pay into a government insurance plan, which in turn pays doctors and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Multi-payer systems operate differently. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Switzerland, for example, residents &lt;a href=&quot;http://international.commonwealthfund.org/countries/switzerland/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;must buy insurance&lt;/a&gt; from competing nonprofit insurers, and the government subsidizes premiums, while also subsidizing doctors and hospitals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;France, often considered to have the best healthcare system in the world, &lt;a href=&quot;http://international.commonwealthfund.org/countries/france/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;requires residents&lt;/a&gt; to enroll in government-funded insurance, but allows for private complementary insurance, too. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though different, the United Kingdom, Canadian, Swiss, and French systems are all considered universal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in each country, the government &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;spends less per capita&lt;/a&gt; on healthcare than the U.S. government spends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, the U.S. government spends more per capita on healthcare than any other government except Norway and the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But high spending doesn’t translate into better health outcomes in the United States. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared with other wealthy countries, the United States has lower life expectancy, a higher infant mortality rate, and significant rates of chronic disease, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2015/oct/us-health-care-from-a-global-perspective&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 report&lt;/a&gt; from the Commonwealth Fund.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Around the world, I tell other countries, you can learn from America’s health system by understanding what not to do,” Hsiao told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why U.S. healthcare stands out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order for a universal system to work, Hsiao said the government must require that everyone participate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ACA’s individual mandate is meant to keep the health insurance market financially sound by pushing healthy people to buy insurance — but it is one of Republicans’ most disliked aspects of the law. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hsiao thinks the reason the United States doesn’t have a universal system is that Americans place such a high value on individual liberty. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you believe individual liberty is most important, it means that everyone can make their own choice, to choose what insurance they have or not,” Hsiao said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s also a matter of history. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United States developed an extensive private health system at a time when other countries lagged behind, according to Gerald Friedman, PhD, a health economist at University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who supports the single-payer movement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After World War II, it was straightforward for other countries to move from minimal coverage to universal programs because they had few private interests to contend with. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Americans, on the other hand, had a vested interest in their private system. Employers and employees wanted to keep insurance as a tax-free job perk, while healthcare providers wanted to protect their income.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those private interests are part of the reason U.S. healthcare is so expensive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For years, Friedman tried to convince people that a single-payer system would save the country money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Then I realized every dollar I talked about saving is a dollar of somebody’s income,” he told Healthline. “It may be a health insurer, it may be a drug company, it may be a hospital.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In countries where health insurance is government-run or nonprofit-run, there is no profit factor to drive up prices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Commonwealth Fund &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/press-releases/2015/oct/us-spends-more-on-health-care-than-other-nations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; found that high healthcare spending in the United States was mostly driven by greater use of technology and higher healthcare prices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, a typical bypass surgery in the Netherlands costs about $15,000 while in the United States it costs about $75,000. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prescription drugs are also pricier in the United States — sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-drug-prices/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more than double&lt;/a&gt; what other countries pay.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s at least in part because other governments evaluate drugs for cost-effectiveness and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/why-the-us-pays-more-for-prescription-drugs-2016-8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;set prices&lt;/a&gt;, but the U.S. government doesn’t. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government agency that runs Medicare is actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://kff.org/medicare/issue-brief/searching-for-savings-in-medicare-drug-price-negotiations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prohibited&lt;/a&gt; from negotiating drug prices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another factor driving up U.S. healthcare costs are administrative expenses, since a system with many different insurance companies creates complex billing arrangements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/9/1586.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Health Affairs&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that those types of expenses made up more than 25 percent of total U.S. hospital expenditures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s about double the rate of administrative expenses in Canada and Scotland, which both have universal, single-payer systems. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the United States reduced those expenses, the study authors estimate it would save more than $150 billion per year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Conservative approaches &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The conservatives who have spoken in favor of universal healthcare — still a minority among right-wing thinkers — tend to prefer multi-payer systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ruddy’s plan, for example, would include private insurance markets, in addition to bolstering Medicaid and Medicare. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another multi-payer model discussed by conservatives is Singapore’s healthcare system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country has a unique &lt;a href=&quot;http://international.commonwealthfund.org/countries/singapore/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;program&lt;/a&gt; that requires citizens to pay into personal accounts — with matching employer contributions — that are used to cover care as part of a subsidized national health insurance scheme. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Avik Roy, Forbes opinion editor and founder of conservative think tank FREOPP, based his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/368772/conservative-case-universal-coverage-avik-roy&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ACA replacement plan&lt;/a&gt; on the Singapore and Swiss models.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a Washington Examiner &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/a-conservative-case-for-universal-health-care-coverage/article/2542091&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt;, Roy wrote, “Singapore and Switzerland spend far less on healthcare than we do and yet achieve all of the things that Americans value about their own system: choice, technology, and physician access.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/10/23/singapore_health_care_what_do_conservatives_like_about_it.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;point out&lt;/a&gt; that both systems are heavily regulated and government subsidized — aspects that traditional conservatives would resist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Roy said he’s been arguing for at least five years that conservatives should embrace the cause of universal coverage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The perception on the right is that universal coverage costs too much and it would require more government intervention in the healthcare system,” Roy told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He disagrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Because the cost of our system is so high, if you have a lower cost system, you could actually cover everyone and spend less money,” Roy said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Roy generally opposes single-payer models, but that’s not true of all conservatives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;F.H. Buckley, a professor at Antonin Scalia Law School at George Mason University, and a Trump supporter, recently called on the president to support a single-payer system, noting that he promised his plan would leave no one uninsured. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The simplest way to do this is universal healthcare, on the Canadian model, with a right of individuals to purchase a Cadillac plan on top of this out-of-pocket,” Buckley &lt;a href=&quot;http://nypost.com/2017/03/30/why-trump-should-embrace-single-payer-health-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in the New York Post&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Medicare for all &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though it’s highly unlikely, if Trump did want to support a single-payer plan, there is one in the works. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sanders said he would introduce a bill to create a single-payer system within weeks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several progressive groups, including the Working Families Party, Social Security Works, and National Nurses United have endorsed the move. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our job is not just to prevent the repeal of the Affordable Care Act,” Sanders told crowds at the Boston rally. “Our job is to join the rest of the industrialized world, [and] guarantee healthcare to all people as a right.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An estimated &lt;a href=&quot;http://kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;28 million&lt;/a&gt; people in America still don’t have health insurance, despite the ACA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supporters say the Medicare for All plan would cut U.S. healthcare costs dramatically and provide universal coverage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A single-payer system would provide enormous efficiencies in administrative costs and in drug savings. Those savings could be used to provide healthcare for everyone without breaking the bank,” said Dr. Adam Gaffney, a board member of the advocacy group Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friedman estimates the Medicare for All plan would save the U.S. economy about $200 billion per year, while expanding access to healthcare services. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If we paid prices for drugs like Europeans and Canadians do, then we would save $100 billion right away,” he added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics of the plan argue that it would lead to higher taxes and increase federal spending, with no guarantee it would rein in costs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But single-payer advocates insist there would be overall savings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For many people, you will see good benefit in paying for healthcare through a tax instead of a premium,” Gaffney said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hsiao and Friedman told Healthline that people generally don’t understand the true costs they already pay for health coverage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your employer gives you a total compensation package,” Hsiao explained. “The health insurance premium paid by the employer squeezes down our cash compensation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Friedman said that a single-payer system would benefit business because the current burden of health insurance raises U.S. labor costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s one factor leading companies to leave the country or to import stuff from other countries, rather than hiring Americans to do it,” he added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/676/cosponsors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medicare for All&lt;/a&gt; bill was already put forward by Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in the House, in January.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bill has virtually no chance of passing and hasn’t even received support from a majority of House Democrats, though Conyers &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RepJohnConyers/status/850088162386993152?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that it has “record-breaking” support compared to previous versions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., one of the bill’s co-sponsors, told Healthline he supports the legislation because he represents a low-income constituency in Memphis that would benefit from it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said that under the AHCA, Memphis would have been among the hardest hit cities for loss of benefits. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If an idea has merit, it’s worth supporting,” Cohen said. “Most new ideas and good ideas take a while to percolate. And if you believe it’s a good idea, you should support it regardless of the political climate.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The high stakes of health reform &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vicki Tosher, a 64-year-old editor from Colorado, told Healthline she’s “been counting down the days” until her 65th birthday, when she will qualify for Medicare. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A three-time breast cancer survivor, she knows too well the financial stress that can accompany a serious illness. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2003, after her second breast cancer diagnosis, Tosher said her medical expenses hit an all-time high, at more than $20,000 for the year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then in 2009, she lost her job, followed by her employer-backed health insurance, and learned that none of the private health insurers in Colorado would cover her because of her previous breast cancer diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The risk of recurrence was just too high,” she told Healthline. “I was uninsurable.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tosher eventually found high-risk coverage through a state program and switched to a cheaper ACA plan when Colorado’s insurance marketplace opened. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, Tosher faced another breast cancer diagnosis, and even with an ACA subsidy, she said the financial hardship is significant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I plan my budget around making sure I have enough money to pay my medical bills,” she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But she knows others who face greater difficulties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tosher helped found the Colorado nonprofit &lt;a href=&quot;http://senseofsecurity.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sense of Security&lt;/a&gt;, which provides grants to people with breast cancer who are struggling financially.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We try to allow them to focus on treatment and healing rather than worrying about whether or not they’re going to be able to feed their families or lose their homes,” she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s people like Tosher and those she’s helped who are at the heart of why health reform causes contentious and emotional debate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No politician wants to be responsible for someone with cancer losing their health insurance or home.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tosher was relieved when Republicans withdrew their ACA replacement bill because she felt the fringes on both sides of the issue would not cooperate to create a workable plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The biggest sense of relief I have is that people are going to have to start talking to one another,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/tech/041017_hearingrestoration_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers may have brought us one step closer to gene therapy for the treatment of hearing loss, after discovering a way to regenerate auditory hair cells in mice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is estimated that about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15 percent&lt;/a&gt; of adults in the United States have some form of hearing loss, with men being twice as likely to develop the condition than women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Damage to the auditory hair cells is one of the leading causes of hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aging is a common risk factor for such damage, although the ailment can also arise through prolonged exposure to loud noise, injury (such as head trauma), ear infections, and other illnesses and diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Auditory hair cells are the tiny sensory cells of the cochlea – the inner part of the ear – that enable us to hear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cells consist of hair-like projections, called stereocilia, that are responsible for transforming sound vibrations into electrical signals that are sent to the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In humans, auditory hair cells are unable to regenerate in order to replace damaged ones. In fish and birds, however, these cells can regenerate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The process involves down-regulating expression of the protein p27 and up-regulating the expression of the protein ATOH1,” notes study co-author Jian Zuo, Ph.D., of the Department of Developmental Neurobiology at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For their study – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(17)30390-X&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; today in the journal Cell Reports – Zuo and team set out to determine whether they could trigger the same process in mice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Using genetic manipulation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using genetic manipulation, the researchers deleted the p27 protein and increased ATOH1 expression in mice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the mice experienced auditory hair cell damage as a result of exposure to loud noise, the researchers found that the cells supporting the auditory hair cells began to transform into auditory hair cells themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Further investigation revealed that a number of proteins work together in order to regenerate auditory hair cells. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the deletion of p27 increased levels of a protein called GATA3 and boosted the expression of the POU4F3 protein. This increased ATOH1 expression, leading to auditory hair cell regeneration in the rodents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers explain that ATOH1 is a transcription factor required for the development of auditory hair cells. In humans, the production of ATOH1 stops in the womb.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Zuo and colleagues, however, their findings suggest that it may be possible to reactivate ATOH1 production in humans by genetically manipulating the p27, GATA3, and POU4F3 proteins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Work in other organs has shown that reprogramming cells is rarely accomplished by manipulating a single factor,&quot; said Zuo. &quot;This study suggests that supporting cells in the cochlea are no exception and may benefit from therapies that target the proteins identified in this study.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said the findings have implications for a phase I clinical trial that is already under way elsewhere using gene therapy to reinstate ATOH1 production in humans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The aim is to determine whether such a strategy can trigger auditory hair cell regeneration in humans, and whether this might be an effective treatment for hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Work continues to identify the other factors, including small molecules, necessary to not only promote the maturation and survival of the newly generated hair cells, but also increase their number,&quot; said Zuo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/081216_homework_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From kindergarten to the final years of high school, recent research suggests that some students are getting excessive amounts of homework.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In turn, when students are pushed to handle a workload that’s out of sync with their development level, it can lead to significant stress — for children and their parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both the National Education Association (NEA) and the National PTA (NPTA) support a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nea.org/tools/16938.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;standard&lt;/a&gt; of “10 minutes of homework per grade level” and setting a general limit on after-school studying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For kids in first grade, that means 10 minutes a night, while high school seniors could get two hours of work per night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the most recent study to examine the issue found that kids in early elementary school received about three times the amount of recommended homework. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Published in The American Journal of Family Therapy, the 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01926187.2015.1061407&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; surveyed more than 1,100 parents in Rhode Island with school-age children. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that first and second graders received 28 and 29 minutes of homework per night. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kindergarteners received 25 minutes of homework per night, on average. But according to the standards set by the NEA and NPTA, they shouldn’t receive any at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A contributing editor of the study, Stephanie Donaldson-Pressman, told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/12/health/homework-elementary-school-study/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt; that she found it “absolutely shocking” to learn that kindergarteners had that much homework. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And all those extra assignments may lead to family stress, especially when parents with limited education aren’t confident in their ability to help kids with the work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers reported that family fights about homework were 200 percent more likely when parents didn’t have a college degree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some parents, in fact, have decided to opt out of the whole thing. The Washington Post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/parenting/wp/2016/08/26/too-much-homework-some-parents-are-just-saying-no/?utm_term=.942c843a12dc&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in 2016 that some parents have just instructed their younger children not to do their homework assignments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They report the no-homework policy has taken the stress out of their afternoons and evenings. In addition, it's been easier for their children to participate in after-school activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new parental directive may be healthier for children, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say there may be real downsides for young kids who are pushed to do more homework than the “10 minutes per grade” standard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The data shows that homework over this level is not only not beneficial to children’s grades or GPA, but there’s really a plethora of evidence that it’s detrimental to their attitude about school, their grades, their self-confidence, their social skills, and their quality of life,” Donaldson-Pressman told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/12/health/homework-elementary-school-study/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Consequences for high school students &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other studies have found that high school students may also be overburdened with homework — so much that it’s taking a toll on their health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2013, research conducted at Stanford University found that students in high-achieving communities who spend too much time on homework experience more stress, physical health problems, a lack of balance in their lives, and alienation from society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That study, published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220973.2012.745469&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Journal of Experimental Education&lt;/a&gt;, suggested that any more than two hours of homework per night is counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, students who participated in the study reported doing slightly more than three hours of homework each night, on average. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To conduct the study, researchers surveyed more than 4,300 students at 10 high-performing high schools in upper middle-class California communities. They also interviewed students about their views on homework.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it came to stress, more than 70 percent of students said they were “often or always stressed over schoolwork,” with 56 percent listing homework as a primary stressor. Less than 1 percent of the students said homework was not a stressor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers asked students whether they experienced physical symptoms of stress, such as headaches, exhaustion, sleep deprivation, weight loss, and stomach problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 80 percent of students reported having at least one stress-related symptom in the past month, and 44 percent said they had experienced three or more symptoms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that spending too much time on homework meant that students were not meeting their developmental needs or cultivating other critical life skills. Students were more likely to forgo activities, stop seeing friends or family, and not participate in hobbies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many students felt forced or obligated to choose homework over developing other talents or skills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Our findings on the effects of homework challenge the traditional assumption that homework is inherently good,&quot; said Denise Pope, Ph.D., a senior lecturer at the Stanford University School of Education, and a co-author of a study. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Working as hard as adults &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A smaller New York University &lt;a href=&quot;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01028/full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last year noted similar findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It focused more broadly on how students at elite private high schools cope with the combined pressures of school work, college applications, extracurricular activities, and parents’ expectations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That study, which appeared in Frontiers in Psychology, noted serious health effects for high schoolers, such as chronic stress, emotional exhaustion, and alcohol and drug use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research involved a series of interviews with students, teachers, and administrators, as well as a survey of a total of 128 juniors from two private high schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About half of the students said they received at least three hours of homework per night. They also faced pressure to take college-level classes and excel in activities outside of school. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many students felt they were being asked to work as hard as adults, and noted that their workload seemed inappropriate for their development level. They reported having little time for relaxing or creative activities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of students said they used alcohol and drugs, primarily marijuana, to cope with stress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers expressed concern that students at high-pressure high schools can get burned out before they even get to college. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“School, homework, extracurricular activities, sleep, repeat — that’s what it can be for some of these students,” said Noelle Leonard, Ph.D., a senior research scientist at the New York University College of Nursing, and lead study author, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2015/08/11/nyu-study-examines-top-high-school-students-stress-and-coping-mechanisms.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can be done? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts continue to debate the benefits and drawbacks of homework.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But according to an article published this year in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/03/homework.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Monitor on Psychology&lt;/a&gt;, there’s one thing they agree on: the quality of homework assignments matters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Stanford study, many students said that they often did homework they saw as &quot;pointless&quot; or &quot;mindless.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pope, who co-authored that study, argued that homework assignments should have a purpose and benefit, and should be designed to cultivate learning and development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s also important for schools and teachers to stick to the 10-minutes per grade standard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with Monitor on Psychology, Pope pointed out that students can learn challenging skills even when less homework is assigned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pope described one teacher she worked with who taught advanced placement biology, and experimented by dramatically cutting down homework assignments. First the teacher cut homework by a third, and then cut the assignments in half. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The students’ test scores didn’t change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You can have a rigorous course and not have a crazy homework load,” Pope said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: The story was originally published on March 11, 2014. It was updated by Jenna Flannigan on August 11, 2016 and then updated again on April 11, 2017 by David Mills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

From ages 45 to 54, the organization recommends annual mammograms and then exams every two years for women 55 and up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2016, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force revised its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/breast-cancer-screening1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. The group now recommends that women under age 50 consult with their doctor. They say women ages 50 to 74 should get screenings every two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a href=&quot;http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1945498-overview&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; women over 40 get an annual mammogram.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These guidelines are for women with an average risk of breast cancer. Most organizations don’t recommend mammograms for most women after age 75.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the survey released today, researchers sent out queries to 1,665 physicians. They got responses from 871 of them. About 44 percent were family medicine or general practitioners. Almost 30 percent worked in internal medicine and another 26 percent were gynecologists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, 81 percent of those responding said they recommended mammograms for women ages 40 to 44. About 88 percent advise women to get the screenings from ages 45 to 49. About 67 percent still recommend them for women 75 years and up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said the gynecologists were more likely to recommend annual screenings than those in the internal medicine and general practice fields.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why the disagreement?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may puzzle people why these medical organizations would have differing opinions on mammograms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Mitva Patel, a breast radiologist at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, says she agrees with annual mammograms beginning at age 40.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason is simple.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the most important aspect is how we can save lives,” Patel told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said some organizations may take into account the legitimate issues of cost, over-diagnosis, and the anxiety of getting a mammogram or a follow-up test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But she looks at just what will help detect breast cancer in a woman at an early age. She notes that 1 in 6 breast cancer cases occur in women ages 40 to 49.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She adds the level of radiation in mammograms is minimal and certainly worth the chance breast cancer can be caught at an early stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patel is 42 years old, and says she has had a mammogram each of the past three years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s what I tell my mom to do and it’s what I do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
t;p&gt;Skin care and makeup used to be two separate entities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, technology and nature are working in sync to create beauty products that creators say make skin look better and protect it from aging elements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barbara Green, who heads up specialty beauty research and development, as well as clinical research for NeoStrata (the company also makes Exuviance products), told Healthline that anti-aging makeup is formulated to deliver cosmetic anti-aging benefits and pigment coverage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It often includes SPF protection as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Anti-aging makeup commonly targets a specific type of benefit such as pigment evening, reduced appearance of fine lines, smoother texture and/or reduced appearance of pore size,” Green noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Superpower ingredients&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Polyhydroxy and bionic acids are “proven powerhouses in anti-aging” that her company is using, Green said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Retinol, peptides, antioxidants, botanical brighteners, stem cell extracts, collagen, and other surface modifiers give the skin instant radiance and smoothing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other ingredients trending in skin care provide targeted benefits based on a novel mechanism of action, including specific peptides or amino acid compounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another area emerging in anti-aging makeup aims to influence the natural microbiome, which is the natural occurrence of bacterial flora that normally populates the skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shoppers will see more products with prebiotics and probiotic lysates entering the market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is an increase in customization of skin care and makeup to meet individual needs of consumers by building regimens or enhancing products with boosters,” Green added. “Expect color to become more customizable and to offer extended benefits beyond traditional protection from UV sunlight and anti-aging effects.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Back to nature&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leah Kirpalani, a certified holistic health coach, clean beauty expert, and founder of the online beauty hub &lt;a href=&quot;http://good-life.co/about/&quot;&gt;Good Life&lt;/a&gt;, said there are more products that use plant-based ingredients in anti-aging skin care and makeup products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;This is positive since many of the chemicals found in our beauty products are what’s actually causing the drying and wear-and-tear of our skin in the first place,” she told Healthline. “Many formulas are turning to plants as a potent form of skin replenishment and age-prevention.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Green tea and arnica are ingredients known to decrease skin inflammation, fight free radicals, and rejuvenate cells. Coconut oil, for instance, is showing up in lipsticks and foundations because it provides better hydration while lessening the occurrence of fine lines and wrinkles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Using products for function to cover fine lines, wrinkles, and blemishes can oftentimes be the culprit of the skin damage in the first place due to its chemical-based ingredients,” Kirpalani said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skin can be inundated with toxic fragrances, allergens, and synthetic preservatives when people use coverage products. That causes clogged pores and long-term exposure to chemicals in the body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Luckily, innovative beauty companies are entering the market with a mindfulness about what ingredients they include — focusing on healing vs. drying and harming,” Kirpalani added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More people are also embracing clean eating, which supports healthy skin and eliminates the need for heavy coverage products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christina Daigneault and Amy Galper, who wrote “Plant-Powered Beauty” coming out next year, agreed that nut and seed oils are gaining traction. Tomato seed, pomegranate seed oil, prickly pear seed oil, sea buckthorn oil, red raspberry seed oil, and butters from Brazil like cupuacu and murumuru are emerging ingredients in skin care and makeup.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vegetable-based butters and oils that are rich in naturally occurring antioxidants are also emerging as more popular ingredients. These include cocoa butter, mango butter, shea butter, and nutrient-rich oils like avocado, pumpkin seed, and black cumin seed, chia, and hemp seed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Daigneault and Galper say these ingredients are naturally rich in essential fatty acids to support cellular health and strength, and nourish skin so it stays supple and protected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Essential oils — frankincense, carrot seed, lavender, rose, sandalwood, and helichrysum — promote tissue regeneration and combat inflammation, and consumers may see more of that when combing beauty product labels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Challenges of beauty and function&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Green said that developing coloring products can be challenging because the anti-aging ingredients have to be able to work with the pigments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some benefit ingredients have pH or other limitations that complicate the formulation approach for color products, she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While “multi-tasking makeup” or “makeup as skin care” products are becoming staples, Kirpalani said there is a catch to ensuring these products are actually improving skin health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Watch out for packaging and marketing that claims to be healing or anti-aging,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kirpalani encourages consumers to look for ingredients they can pronounce and plant-derived sources. Avocado oil, grapeseed oil, vitamin E, and neem are skin healers that can also do double duty within lotion and foundation formulas — both healing the skin and providing results-oriented functionality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest challenges of making functional products is that you don’t want to overload a formula or make an unstable formula,” Helen Knaggs, PhD, vice president of research and development for Nu Skin, told Healthline. “When formulating, you have to find ingredients that work well together and that happily coexist. Also, loading a formula with a lot of key ingredients is not always a good thing and could be too much for an individual’s skin.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for what’s next in the industry, it will be products that combine antipollution and anti-aging ingredients for long-term benefits and instant aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knaggs predicts more focus on skin care regimens and systems to accentuate the benefits of the makeup. This can include cleansers, cleaning devices, and products that offer multiple advantages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Expect more long-wear cosmetics to emerge as well, she noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It would be wonderful to have products that were easy to apply, looked great right after application, offered protection from pollution, as well as longer term anti-aging benefits. Double duty is already out there. In the future we will see more of a demand for triple duty,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, government officials from federal and state levels have once again called for renewed efforts aimed at tackling America’s opioid epidemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These measures range from limiting opioid prescriptions to getting more people into addiction treatment programs to investigating the role of pharmaceutical companies in fueling the crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2015, opioids caused more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;33,000 deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the United States — a new record — according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prescription opioids — such as &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/methadone/oral-tablet#Highlights1&quot;&gt;methadone&lt;/a&gt;, OxyContin, and Vicodin — accounted for almost half of opioid overdose deaths. The rest were due to other opioids such as heroin and synthetic fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Will government efforts be enough to prevent more people from becoming addicted and help those who already have an opioid use disorder?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Industry’s role in epidemic&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) requested internal documents from five top opioid manufacturers about their marketing tactics and what they knew about the possible risks of addiction and abuse related to opioid painkillers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She is also seeking information on whether companies donated to groups that may have been working to block increased regulation of opioids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s time to look at the manufacturers and find out what they knew about addiction … [and] what marketing practices did they use to push these drugs,” McCaskill said in a conference call on Tuesday, as reported by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/28/sen-claire-mccaskill-opens-probe-opioid-drugmakers/99702506/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;USA Today&lt;/a&gt;. “We want to get to the bottom of why all of a sudden opioids have been handed out like candy in this country.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The investigation currently focuses on five companies with the largest sales of opioids: Purdue Pharma, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Insys Therapeutics, Mylan, and Depomed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past, Chicago and other localities have sued manufacturers over “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-pfizer-opioid-marketing-20160705-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deceptive marketing&lt;/a&gt;” of prescription drugs involved in the opioid epidemic — alleging these practices began as far back as the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lawsuits accuse manufacturers of downplaying the addictive nature of opioids, leading to overprescribing of opioid pain medications. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) also recently pushed for President Donald Trump to discuss with Chinese President, Xi Jinping, China’s role in manufacturing synthetic opioids like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rob-portman-trump-china-fentanyl_us_58e53a20e4b0fe4ce087a7da&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These drugs are sometimes smuggled into the United States from Canada or Mexico, but they are increasingly shipped directly from China by mail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fentanyl is more potent than prescription pain medications and heroin. Over the past year, many states have seen a spike in &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/US/fentanyl-deaths-spiked-us-sign-slowing/story?id=44554601&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fentanyl overdose deaths&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tackling opioid overprescribing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some states are trying to limit the availability of prescription opioids by enacting new opioid prescribing regulations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Ohio, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170330/new-rule-limits-narcotic-painkiller-prescriptions-to-seven-days&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new rule&lt;/a&gt; limits acute pain prescriptions to no more than seven days of opioid pain medications — or five for minors. Currently, doctors can prescribe 30 to 90 days of opioids. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These types of restrictions straddle a line between preventing opioid abuse and tying a doctor’s hands when it comes to treating patients’ pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have a lot of concerns about inappropriate or overprescribing of opioids. However, I also have a lot of concerns about regulating medical practice, particularly at the level of how you manage the pain of a patient,” Dr. Itai Danovitch, chairman and associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new Ohio rule will not apply to patients with cancer or those in palliative or hospice care or medication-assisted addiction treatment programs. These exemptions earned the approval of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2017/03/pain_prescription_limits_set.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ohio State Medical Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;States also use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virginia.gov/services/virginia-prescription-monitoring-program/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prescription monitoring programs&lt;/a&gt; to prevent patients from obtaining opioid pills from multiple doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Virginia, “physicians are required to log into a database to assess whether a patient has previously been prescribed opioids, to minimize the chances of so-called ‘doctor shopping,’” Kevin Doyle, EdD, LPC, LSATP, a professor in the Counselor Education program at Longwood University in Virginia, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These kinds of efforts “may help prevent the problem down the road, but there’s the issue of the people who are currently addicted and need treatment,” said Doyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trump commission to address opioids&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Trump is expected to sign an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/03/28/trump-opioids-executive-order/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; setting up a commission to address the nation’s growing opioid epidemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The panel would identify federal funding that could be used to help people with opioid use disorder. Programs would include long-term support services and medical treatments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some have hailed the additional focus on the crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Trump’s commission is a good thing. It’s never a bad thing to really investigate an issue,” Deni Carise, PhD, chief clinical officer for Recovery Centers of America, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She also pointed out that U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://addiction.surgeongeneral.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in November highlighting the country’s addiction crisis and steps to address it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of guidance that I think we can get from that document that’s already been made by a full commission of experts,” said Carise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Medical Association, which focuses on raising awareness of the opioid crisis among physicians, applauded the creation of the new commission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some worry that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-opioid-commission-budget_us_58dc4fd5e4b05eae031d0d10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;budget cuts proposed by Trump&lt;/a&gt; to the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — along with a reorganization of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — may work against the commission’s goals. These agencies fund treatment programs and research into improved treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the Republican’s Affordable Care Act (ACA) replacement — had it passed — would have eliminated addiction treatment coverage for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/09/gop-health-care-bill-would-drop-mental-health-coverage-mandate-covering-1-3-million-americans/?utm_term=.b616ffab45d6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1.3 million Americans on Medicaid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This type of coverage was not always available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ACA, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-truth-about-exercise-addiction/201703/how-would-trumpcare-affect-mental-health-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act&lt;/a&gt;, and other recent legislation required insurance companies to provide mental health coverage — including substance misuse treatment — similar to medical and surgical benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Those are really vital achievements that are absolutely critical to safeguard in the event that there are any changes to our healthcare system,” said Danovitch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In spite of the improvements in mental health coverage, &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.samhsa.gov/data/2k14/NSDUH200/sr200-findings-overview-2014.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;89 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Americans who needed treatment for an illegal drug or alcohol problem did not receive treatment in the past year, according to 2013 federal data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://medcitynews.com/2017/04/insurance-policies-substance-use-disorder-benefits/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; published by Danovitch and colleagues in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs also found big differences in the quality of substance abuse benefits offered by California health insurance plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Getting more people into treatment means addressing many issues, including access to quality programs, affordability, and insurance coverage. This is especially true for certain segments of the population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s really been the tough area is your average American with basic health insurance being able to find a place that will take them and be able to bill their insurance for the majority of costs,” said Carise. “That’s the area where we really need to focus as a country.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/041017_chinahealth_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, oncologist and cancer researcher Steven Rosen took a leadership role at City of Hope, the cancer hospital and research institution near Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the first things he did was gather his new colleagues together to discuss where the hospital should focus its burgeoning international health focus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It didn’t take long for everyone to agree where they should concentrate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not about excluding others, but we decided to put our energy into a relationship with China,” Rosen told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since that consensus, Rosen said, the hospital’s 10-person Center for International Medicine has established alliances with several prominent cancer hospitals in China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These partnerships enable City of Hope to share its quality care practices and training with China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In return, City of Hope benefits from the breadth of knowledge of Chinese physicians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The alliances also create jobs and establish friendships between two of the most powerful nations on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve been to China twice as part of this endeavor, and I have been so impressed with the quality of people I’ve met,” Rosen said. “The people we have recruited in this alliance are humble, bright, and talented. The friendships have evolved quickly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Second opinions halfway around the world&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two primary goals of the hospital’s alignment with China, Rosen explained, are to advance global cancer research, therapy, and diagnostics, as well as to make sure individuals in China have access to the best cancer care available in China and the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the programs being launched is a “remote second opinion” program for people with blood cancers at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, the most populous city in the central China province of Hubei. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this scenario, City of Hope doctors will review diagnoses and provide second opinions to the Tongji Hospital’s doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They won’t, however, communicate directly with the patients because the U.S. doctors are not allowed to practice medicine in China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;City of Hope is also working with a private company in China to oversee cancer care at a new hospital being built in Shenzhen, one of China’s largest cities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Shenzhen is a relatively young and affluent city,” Ed McCarthy, the City of Hope vice president who runs the Center for International Medicine, told Healthline. “It’s an innovation and knowledge hub, but it doesn’t have strong healthcare institutions. If you’re a patient with cancer in that city, there’s a good chance you will drive somewhere else to be seen. There’s a gap in care there.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Number one goal: Save lives&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most fruitful endeavors of the initiative so far, City of Hope executives tell Healthline, is the partnership with the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (SAHZU) in Zhejiang, a province in eastern China. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;City of Hope doctors and scientists participate in educational exchanges with SAHZU physicians and scientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also provide additional consultation on the treatment plans of people with cancer being treated at SAHZU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Dr. Yuman Fong, City of Hope's chair of surgery, and one of the world's most respected cancer surgeons, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.prnasia.com/story/137235-0.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the partnership with SAHZU, he said the shared knowledge and training between the two hospitals “help save lives.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rosen added that the decision to reach out to China made sense for many reasons, including the demographics of the hospital’s surrounding neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A quarter of the patient population at City of Hope, he said, is of Asian ancestry, mostly from greater China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A new age in healthcare cooperation?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While political relations between the two nations may be strained, it’s a different story on the healthcare front, where relations are positive and collaborative.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rosen said these international partnerships benefit both nations as well as the entire world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When China and the U.S. are aligned, the planet is safer,” he said. “If China and the U.S. are not aligned, then you have to pray. God knows what will happen. The people of both countries have a spirit that you can embrace, both are clearly focused on benefitting all of humanity in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cancer drug companies join forces&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In China, a nation of about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/china-population/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; people, cancer is the number one cause of death. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People in China have profoundly unmet needs in healthcare, including lack of access to quality treatments — especially among its poorest citizens. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The government, while pro-science and pro-research, can still sometimes apply excessive restrictions on foreign entry into China’s marketplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drug companies from the United States have found it difficult to get their products into China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that’s changing quickly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several U.S. biopharmaceutical companies with treatments on the market or in clinical trials have established partnerships in the past few years with Chinese companies to co-develop and sell cancer treatments in China and globally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s already been a productive and collaborative 2017.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January, Kite Pharma, the California-based biopharmaceutical company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ir.kitepharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=1007279&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a joint venture with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical to develop and commercialize Kite’s CAR-T cell immunotherapies for blood cancers in China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The venture, Fosun Pharma Kite Biotechnology Co., is expected to be a world leader in advancing the CAR-T technology, which harnesses the power of the body’s immune system (T cells) to recognize and kill cancer tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In clinical trials, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/cr/journal/v27/n1/full/cr2016154a.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CAR-T&lt;/a&gt; is generating headlines for the high percentage of complete responses and durable remissions the treatment is producing in people with lymphoma and leukemia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Helen Kim, Kite’s executive vice president of business development, told Healthline that for Kite, China represents a “significant future market, given the population and high incidences of certain cancers. Kite is committed to bringing its transformational therapies to patients worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added that China is embracing innovative technologies for healthcare, including therapies for unmet needs like cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Chinese regulators have demonstrated flexibility in requirements to get innovative therapies to market,” Kim said. “Large regional pharmaceutical companies such as Fosun Pharma are actively seeking collaborations to bring technologies to China.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kim cited another recent U.S.-China venture between Fosun and Intuitive Surgical, the Northern California-based global leader in robotic-assisted, minimally invasive surgery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The collaboration will help the companies develop and sell innovative, robotic-assisted, catheter-based medical devices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are pleased to expand our partnership and advance the development of medical tools to enhance the wellbeing of global populations, including those in China that suffer from increased rates of lung cancer,” Chen Qiyu, chairman of Fosun Pharma, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://investor.intuitivesurgical.com/mobile.view?c=122359&amp;amp;v=203&amp;amp;d=1&amp;amp;id=2206833&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Meeting healthcare needs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;CASI Pharmaceuticals, the Maryland-based biopharmaceutical company, has adopted China’s unmet medical needs as its primary focus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company, which plans to bring several drugs to the Chinese market, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.casipharmaceuticals.com/investor-relations/news/casi-pharmaceuticals-announces-availabilty-of-anti-cancer-drug-zevalin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in July 2015 that it had licensed Zevalin, an FDA-approved, radio-immunotherapy for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and plans to commercialize it in Hong Kong and, eventually, greater China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zevalin, which is owned and sold in the United States by Nevada-based Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, will be available at hospitals such as Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In China, it will be supplied by CASI and its local partner, Global Medical Solutions Hong Kong Limited.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are very excited to work with Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital to make Zevalin available to patients,” Ken K. Ren, CASI’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added that while Hong Kong is a relatively small market, it provides the company with clinical knowledge and experience for Zevalin in a Chinese patient population, “which we believe will have a positive impact in market penetration when Zevalin is approved and becomes available in our greater China markets.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Clinical trials in both countries&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In February, Denovo Biopharma, a precision medicine company with offices in San Diego and Hangzhou, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crossroadstoday.com/story/34519426/denovo-biopharma-plans-to-launch-a-global-phase-3-trial-of-db102-enzastaurin-in-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it will launch a phase III clinical trial in China and the United States for its lead drug for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“China will play a very important role in the biomarker-driven DB102 trial, and we have successfully submitted the Investigational New Drug application to the China FDA,” Isabel Han, head of Denovo's clinical operations in Beijing, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FierceBiotech &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/lilly-chi-med-cancer-med-hits-phase-3-goals-eyes-china-nda&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that Hong Kong-based Hutchison China MediTech and U.S. pharmaceutical partner Eli Lilly have seen positive results in trials of the drug they’re co-developing for people with certain colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In phase III trials of more than 4,500 patients in China, the treatment showed a significant increase in survival rates. The partnership is expected to file for approval with China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) within a few months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Spending billions for U.S. companies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;China’s pharmaceutical industry is still far behind the United States, but China healthcare companies and investors are spending billions of dollars to acquire U.S. healthcare companies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to PitchBook, there have been 214 deals made in the past five years between Chinese investors and healthcare companies based in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bloomberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-05/china-inc-goes-on-a-buying-spree-for-global-health-care-assets&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that last year China’s Humanwell Healthcare Group, which makes anesthetics and contraceptive drugs, spent more than a half a billion dollars to purchase New York-based generic drug maker Epic Pharma last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OncoImmune, a Maryland-based biopharmaceutical company, is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.finsmes.com/2017/01/oncoimmune-closes-15-0m-series-a-funding-round.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; with China investors to develop new immunotherapies for cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;OncoImmune’s recent funding round of $15 million was led by 3E Bioventures Capital, a healthcare-focused investor in China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nonprofits’ link to China&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Children’s Treehouse Foundation, a Colorado-based nonprofit whose sole mission is to assist children who have a mother or father with cancer, is already in 77 cancer hospitals in the United States. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it is now in Hong Kong and hopes to increase its presence in greater China. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The foundation’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://childrenstreehousefdn.org/climb-programs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CLIMB Program&lt;/a&gt;, which in scientific studies has been shown to greatly improve kids’ ability to cope with a parent’s illness, is installed at the Hong Kong Cancer Fund, a patient advocacy organization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Denis Murray, executive director of the foundation, said there is great need for patient support in China, where cancer has grown at alarming rates in the past 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is telling that countries like China have to go halfway across the world to find models for psychosocial support,” Murray told Healthline. “Because of the internet, international organizations can find us, learn about CLIMB, and get trained so they can use it with their cancer patients.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the long run, Murray said, mutual benefits should result from this exchange.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Other countries can benefit from models developed in the U.S., and we can learn how to make our programs more culturally appropriate for cancer patients here and across the globe,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cognoa, the California-based consumer healthcare company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobihealthnews.com/content/cognoa-raises-116m-continue-validation-fda-submission-child-development-assessment-app&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last month that it raised $11 million in its latest round of funding to design apps that assess child development and behavioral health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of that money came from Morningside, the Hong Kong-based venture capital and social responsibility firm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nonprofit brings companies together&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The US China Innovation Alliance (UCIA), a Texas-based nonprofit, is immersed in this global trend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The organization works to bring innovative U.S. and Chinese companies together. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At its upcoming summit next month, the organization expects to host about 200 companies from China. More than half are either in the healthcare field or interested in investing in it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Xinxin Li, director of development of the nonprofit, said that among the drivers of this growing trend are hospital reforms in China and the needs of China’s aging population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“China focusing on healthcare innovation and reforms have contributed to this trend,” she told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hospital systems in China can go private now, Li noted, “compared to before, when they were only managed by the government. Most hospitals are still public, the change is slow, but this reform has created opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another driver for these new U.S.-China healthcare alliances, Li said, is China’s changing demographics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not unlike America’s baby boom generation, Li noted, “China’s aging population is creating emerging needs for healthcare and the U.S. is the largest [research and development] and innovation generator.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Li said that people in China who are her parents’ age don’t just want good medicine, they want well-being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My parent’s generation, who are of retirement age, are living longer after retiring, and they need better care, and they can afford that kind of care,” she said. “This demand is driving the market. Hospitals in China are seeking more information about overseas health care experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

ea is generally considered good for you, but there hasn’t been a lot of science behind that claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now a team of scientists at National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine has put a bit of muscle into the discussion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, experts interviewed by Healthline say there are still a lot of unanswered questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Singapore &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27925140&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging, the research team concluded that drinking tea regularly lowered the risk for cognitive impairment in older adults by 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this rate of reduced cognitive decline increased by as much as 86 percent for people who carry the APOE e4 gene (apolipoprotein E), which puts them genetically at higher risk of developing &lt;a href=&quot;/health/alzheimers-disease-overview&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feng Lei, an assistant professor in the department of psychological medicine at the Singapore school, pointed out that the bioactive compounds in tea leaves, including catechins, theaflavins, thearubigins, and &lt;a href=&quot;/health/l-theanine&quot;&gt;L-theanine&lt;/a&gt;, have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential that create this long-term benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These and other bioactive properties also protect the brain from vascular damage and neurodegeneration, according to Lei.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings have important implications for dementia prevention,” Lei said in a press release. “Despite high-quality drug trials, effective pharmacological therapy for neurocognitive disorders, such as dementia, remains elusive and current prevention strategies are far from satisfactory.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This discovery, he said, might provide an easy, inexpensive health benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Tea is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. The data from our study suggest that a simple and inexpensive lifestyle measure, such as daily tea drinking, can reduce a person’s risk for developing neurocognitive disorders in late life,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Conclusions and questions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to determine the association between tea consumption habits and the incidence of neurocognitive disorders, the investigative team collected tea consumption data for 957 community-living Chinese adults aged 55 years or older from 2003 to 2005.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also gathered information on cases of neurocognitive disorders from 2006 to 2010, noting that all the participants were cognitively intact at baseline when the study began.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lei and colleagues identified 72 incident cases of neurocognitive disorders within the group. Independent of other risk factors, consumption of both green tea and black/oolong tea reduced the risk of incidents linked to neurocognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tea study has been met with mild interest and a lot of questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to James A. Hendrix, PhD, director of global science initiatives at the Alzheimer’s Association, a lot more work needs to be done on the subject. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m always a little skeptical of associative studies,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because two things occur at the same time does not prove one caused the other, he noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need independent research on this subject. If they find a similar link, maybe we should investigate,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hendrix recalled the results from tests of other dietary supplements, notably vitamins “that were touted as a treatment. That was disappointing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another issue with the study, Hendrix said, is that it was conducted on a homogeneous population. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lei acknowledged this in a press release: “While the study was conducted on Chinese elderly, the results could apply to other races as well.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the data was gathered based on self-reports, which Hendrix noted was a weakness. “People were asked how much tea they drank. They weren’t monitored by a third party,” he said. “That creates issues.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More questions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study also raised other questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How long does a person have to drink tea to get the potential benefits?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What happens if you are not a lifetime tea drinker, but start at age 50? Or 60?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And how much tea is enough? One cup? Five?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s important to recognize how long one has been doing this,” Hendrix said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He cited a Finnish study of people with dementia who showed a slowing of symptoms when they engaged in regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He suggested the same issue around food and drink. If you don’t start early, do you have a higher risk? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The Mediterranean diet is beneficial to the cardiovascular system,” Hendrix said. “And what’s good for the heart is good for the brain.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t know if it works if you’ve eaten a bad Western diet until you’re 75 and then switch to a healthier one,” he said. “But it can’t hurt.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can you do?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent poll showed that for the first time more people worry about getting dementia than cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that leads to Hendrix’s best advice: Develop a healthy lifestyle. Eat a balanced diet. Exercise. Quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s unlikely the solution will be a single substance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Susan Weiner doesn’t think that tea is a magic pill either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nutritionist and registered dietician called the study interesting, but she’d like to see more study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“More research is needed,” she told Healthline, “but it's promising due to the antioxidant properties, which may have a very positive impact on cognitive function.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a more mundane level, she said, “tea can be a delicious addition to your diet. Also … when no sweeteners are added they are calorie-free.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Today, a diagnosis can take months or even years to confirm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iquity.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;IQuity&lt;/a&gt;, a start-up company based in Tennessee, plans to launch such a test in May. They claim it has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://iquity-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/App/Models/Article/files/000/000/020/original/multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com-IQuity%20to%20Release%207-Day%20Blood%20Diagnostics%20Test%20for%20Multiple%20Sclerosis%20in%20May.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; success rate in detecting MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To date, no one test can guarantee a diagnosis of MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, diagnosing MS is accomplished taking a detailed medical history and through &lt;a href=&quot;/health/multiple-sclerosis/tests-diagnose&quot;&gt;tests&lt;/a&gt; such as a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the brain and/or spinal cord and the process of elimination for other illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Due to the disease’s ability to mimic symptoms of other illnesses, and because no two people present MS symptoms exactly the same, the diagnosis process can sometimes be a guessing game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The quicker, the better&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, leads the organization’s team, whose goal is to invest the agency’s resources in the most impactful way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is an unmet need for speedier and more accurate ways to diagnose MS,” Bebo told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The current process requires a process of elimination that can take time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Having a blood-based test could simplify or speed up the process, both of which would be advancement in treating MS.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted that the earlier MS is treated, the better the outcome. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the test did well in trials with MS patients, the real crux is how will it perform in the broader population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order for the test to be truly effective, Bebo said it will need to help neurologists speed up the diagnosis process. He added this test is not likely to &quot;stand on its own&quot; but would be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tools.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The blood test works by detecting patterns in RNA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23748426&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RNA-based research&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 successfully identified profiles in people with MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the profile was identified, an algorithm was created to find a pattern of molecules specific to diseases like MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s this proprietary algorithm that lead to $4 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as well as significant private investment for IQuity’s blood test.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Optimism for the future&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the new IsolateMS test will have much to prove after hitting the market, those connected with MS are generally excited about where things are now vs. 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are currently 15 disease modifying drugs (DMDs) for MS, all developed in the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, the first drug for &lt;a href=&quot;/health/multiple-sclerosis/what-is-primary-progressive&quot;&gt;primary-progressive MS (PPMS)&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/new-multiple-sclerosis-drug-awaits-approval&quot;&gt;approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The landscape continues to change for those with the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Chase Spurlock, founder and chief executive officer of IQuity and co-inventor of the new test, is hopeful about the future of MS medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spurlock started work on his project during his time at Vanderbilt University, hitting critical mass in 2013. IQuity formed in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the test does not differentiate between &lt;a href=&quot;/health/multiple-sclerosis/types-of-ms#YourType1&quot;&gt;relapsing-remitting MS&lt;/a&gt; and PPMS, it is designed to find general patterns for diagnostic purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently the clinical criteria to differentiate between types of MS has not been 100 percent codified, Spurlock said, but the ability to accomplish this is in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The future holds many opportunities,” Spurlock told Healthline. “RNA patterns change in response to stimuli, such as a possible viral response.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added that figuring out the first event that leads to an illness would be significant in preventing and stopping progression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This test could eventually help doctors decide the best treatment for a person with MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spurlock suggested in the future doctors will be able to “look at an RNA profile or molecular picture and decide on the first day what’s happening, and would they be better on one therapy vs. another.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Bebo and Spurlock shared the importance of early diagnoses and treatment as supported in the international consensus recommendations of 2016: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27640924&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brain health: Time matters in multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;IsolateMS does not need approval from the FDA because it is marketed and sold as a laboratory-developed test under The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spurlock says the NIH funding “allows us to throw a foot on the gas in moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

<title>Trying to Build a Better Sunscreen</title>

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/040717_sunscreen_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How often do you apply sunscreen? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, everyone would adhere to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection/sunscreen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Skin Cancer Foundation recommendations&lt;/a&gt; and reapply sunscreen every two hours or immediately after swimming or sweating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the reality is often quite different. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sunscreen loses its effectiveness over time, making reapplication vital in avoiding damage to the skin. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But now, researchers in the United Kingdom are examining the ingredients in sunscreen in the hope of developing a longer-lasting product. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sunscreens have been around for decades, so you'd think we know all there is to know about them, but we really don't,” Vasilios Stavros, PhD, associate professor of physical chemistry at the University of Warwick, said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If we better understand how the molecules in sunscreen absorb light, then we can manipulate the molecules to absorb more energy, and we can protect the molecules from degradation. If the molecule doesn't break down, there's no need to reapply,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings from Stavros and his team were reported earlier this month at a meeting of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection/sunscreen&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Chemical Society (ACS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Chemical reactions in sunscreen&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the chemical filters in sunscreen that absorb energy from the sun. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“UV filter molecules in sunscreens absorb radiation and convert highly toxic ‘electronic’ energy into ‘vibrational motion’ or ‘heat.’ Once the UV filter molecule has diffused this energy as heat, it is ready to reabsorb another photon of UV radiation and repeat the cycle,” Stavros told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In some cases, the chemical filters can fail by breaking into pieces or getting stuck in the excited state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stavros’ team sought to determine what was causing this chemical filter dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They used lasers to replicate the sun’s energy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In one instance, Stavros’ team found that 10 percent of the molecules in the common sunscreen ingredient oxybenzone get stuck in the excited state when under a laser.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stavros suggests that this finding could pave the way for chemical manipulations that would allow for a longer-lasting sunscreen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many sunscreens on the market are made of both chemical and physical ingredients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chemical ingredients work by absorbing UV radiation and preventing penetration into the skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Physical ingredients work by deflecting UV radiation off the skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The dangers of sun exposure&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, dermatologists say many people struggle to keep to the guidelines of reapplying sunscreen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Compliance with sunscreen application is one of the toughest challenges — it’s easy to say ‘reapply sunscreen to exposed areas every two hours,’ not always so easy to practice,” Dr. Adam Friedman, an associate professor of dermatology at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Creating sunscreens that stay active longer will no doubt improve consumer/patient compliance and allow for better protective strategies.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection/swimming&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Skin Cancer Foundation&lt;/a&gt; recommends applying one ounce of sunscreen (about the size of a golf ball) to your entire body 30 minutes before going outside.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“About 90 percent of nonmelanoma skin cancers are associated with exposure to UV radiation from the sun, and if you have a visible sign of sun exposure, like a tan or sunburn, this means you’ve sustained skin cell damage,” a spokesperson for the Skin Cancer Foundation told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, more than 5 million cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer are treated in more than 3 million people each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Annually, there are more new cases of skin cancer than prostate, breast, lung, and colon cancers combined. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Skin Cancer Foundation estimates 87,110 new cases of invasive melanoma will be diagnosed in the United States in 2017. An estimated 9,730 people will die of the disease this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may be a long way to go before a longer-lasting sunscreen is developed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Friedman says when selecting a sunscreen, consumers should look for a product that has an SPF rating of 30 or higher, is broad spectrum, and is water resistant for up to 80 minutes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The best sunscreen is one you will use again and again. The kind of sunscreen selected is a matter of personal choice and may vary depending on the area of the body to be protected,” Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He suggests creams are best for dry skin and the face, gels are good for hairy areas like the scalp or male chest, and sticks are good for around the eyes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s also important to realize sunscreen is not enough. Seek shade when appropriate, remembering that the sun’s rays are strongest between&amp;nbsp;10 a.m. and 2 p.m.&amp;nbsp;If your shadow is shorter than you are, seek shade.&amp;nbsp;Wear protective clothing, such as a long-sleeved shirt, pants, a wide brim hat, and sunglasses, when possible,” Friedman said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stavros’ research is ongoing, and he is confident the resulting data will shed more light on how sunscreens work. But he believes the future of longer-lasting sunscreens will be the result of collaborative work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are a number of teams around the world working in highly complementary areas like theory, industry, research and development and getting some truly beautiful results,” he said. “I believe through collaborative efforts we can really make huge steps toward making next-generation sunscreens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
&gt;Cancer treatment can go on for months or even years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a long time to wear awkward hospital gowns or struggle with clothing during chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to appearance, there are hats, bandanas, and wigs available, but people with cancer have other needs, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s about comfort and practicality, but it’s also about feeling like you’re still you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A small army of entrepreneurs is changing the way people with cancer dress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For many of them, the idea stems from personal experience. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dignity and empowerment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When cancer upended the lives of sisters Peg, Patty, and Claire, they realized just how important clothing choices could be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When there was any choice at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trio co-founded &lt;a href=&quot;https://healingthreads.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Healing Threads&lt;/a&gt; to address the issues they experienced firsthand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Claire lost her life in 2006 to metastatic colon cancer after 35 months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peg was treated for stage 3 melanoma, and has been cancer-free since 2002.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patty has not had cancer, but she provided support for her two sisters. She remains a part of Healing Threads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peg Feodoroff, also known as “spirited sister #1,” is president of the Massachusetts company. She said the clothing was originally designed for people with cancer but has morphed into much more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She told Healthline that the clothing line is helpful for men and women going back and forth for any type of medical treatments, including kidney dialysis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The line features breakaway pants to provide easy access to the legs or hips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I designed those, my experience with cancer was melanoma,” said Feodoroff. “For anyone with melanoma on their leg, I thought they would prefer to wear these pants and expose only what has to be exposed when it has to be exposed, rather than take their pants off for the radiation table.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feodoroff said a doctor once told her that he looks at people differently when they’re wearing a hospital gown rather than street clothes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It strips a person down to the lowest common denominator so you all look alike and all you are is a name on a bracelet. There’s nothing to distinguish you from anybody else,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One goal of Healing Threads is to help people maintain dignity and modesty while undergoing cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another goal is empowerment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Being a baby boomer, and in the throes of the feminist movement many times, I want women in particular to take charge, demand answers, and be part of the decision-making process or even get a second opinion because they’re wearing a Healing Thread. That’s who we are and what we wanted to do,” said Feodoroff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The versatile tops are particularly popular with women who’ve had mastectomies. You can wear the clothing in the hospital after surgery, but it’s ideal for those first weeks at home. Built-in provisions for drainage bags provide comfort and privacy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The clothing is meant to go from treatment to public to home without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And all that helps you feel more like yourself and less like a cancer patient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Feodoroff laughed as she recalled her sister’s “horror” at having to wear a fanny pack to carry her chemo pump. She wouldn’t have had to use that option if she’d had a Healing Thread top.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, how do doctors and nurses feel about nonhospital-issue clothing?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Feodoroff, feedback from the medical community has been complimentary. Nurses note that the clothes are not just better looking than a hospital gown, they’re also quite functional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A customer wrote Feodoroff to say, “Mom lost her battle but she did not lose her dignity during the treatments. Her love will remain in our hearts forever and always.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sisters’ compassionate touch shines through in their clothing designs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We really love the human race and want to help women especially get through this horrible disease they’re facing,” said Feodoroff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fashion and fun for children&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jessica Kidd, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.graciesgowns.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gracie's Gowns&lt;/a&gt;, is a virtual one-woman show.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She’s president, chief executive officer, and primary seamstress of the Virginia-based nonprofit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gracie’s Gowns provides clothing for children with cancer and other illnesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is important to these children and their parents because they're able to feel like they're not in the hospital setting,” Kidd wrote in an email to Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The children feel more at home, but they also have an increased self-worth that they are more than a room number or diagnosis and can be seen for the child they truly are. It inspires hope for families to continue each difficult day, regardless of the outcome,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gowns are custom-made for each child. The fabric colors and patterns are chosen to match their interests. Careful attention is paid to getting the size right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The design itself is completely different from the traditional hospital gown. Ultimately, the part that sets us above from any other organization is that each gown is personalized with the first name of the child it is made for, and the family is not charged a penny to receive it,” said Kidd.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gracie’s Gowns has created 3,511 unique gowns in five years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kidd previously worked in emergency services, medical transports, and pediatric critical care. She observed the problems children had with awkward, ill-fitting hospital gowns that were often made from irritating fabrics. The problem really hit home when her own child needed hospital care for a few days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea for custom-made gowns for children came to her as she worked on a hospital gown for a friend. The organization was named in honor of her friend’s child, Grace, who passed away due to &lt;a href=&quot;/health/neuroblastoma&quot;&gt;neuroblastoma&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I wanted to show each child they truly mattered to someone and in some way help them smile in the darkest of times. I wanted them to know they weren't just room 2034 bed B, the kid with cancer. They weren't just a statistic, or even just one of those kids that spend most of their time in the hospital,” Kidd wrote on her website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The organization also donates gowns directly to hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A growing number of options&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ingawellbeing.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;INGA Wellbeing&lt;/a&gt; makes stylish clothing for men and women in treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nikla Lancksweert co-founded the company after watching her mother go through ovarian cancer treatment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/03/26/521271203/trendy-hospital-clothing-to-make-cancer-patients-dress-well-even-when-unwell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;, Lancksweert spoke of the company’s back-opening dress for women, which is designed to take the place of a hospital gown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But you would never guess it. I've worn it in the playground. I've worn it to the supermarket, often meetings — not having had a chance to change — but it has all that sort of ease of opening in that it opens at the back and it also has openings down the arms and a very discreet opening to the stomach,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ronwear.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;RonWear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chemocozy.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Chemo Cozy&lt;/a&gt; clothing lines feature colorful items with strategically placed zippers. The pieces are meant to feel cozy and help you get through treatment without having to disrobe or bare too much skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The clothes are designed to look as natural in public as your regular clothes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people need an intravenous line called a PICC that remains in place between tests and treatments. Patients generally wear a dressing to cover and protect it. It’s a constant reminder of treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.careandwear.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Care + Wear&lt;/a&gt; sells a range PICC line covers in a variety of sizes and colors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the potential side effects of mastectomy is &lt;a href=&quot;/health/lymphatic-obstruction&quot;&gt;lymphedema&lt;/a&gt;, due to lymph node removal. One way to combat this is by wearing compression sleeves. &lt;a href=&quot;http://lymphedivas.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lymphedivas&lt;/a&gt; offers compression sleeves and gloves that do the job, but with designs that are bold, sassy, or elegant to suit any occasion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, a simple pair of socks can make all the difference in the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jake Teitelbaum was no fan of the poorly made, unattractive, nonslip socks hospitals give to patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In treatment for refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, he started bringing his own colorful socks to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It made him feel so much better that he founded the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.resilience.gives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Resilience Project&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that sells fun socks online. Half of the proceeds help provide financial assistance to people with chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It helped,” he wrote on his website. “It may seem ridiculous, but that little change reminded me that ultimately, I was in control of my experience. Whatever the circumstances, no matter how little I wanted to be isolated in the hospital, I could choose to use this as an opportunity to learn and grow as a person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/040717_tourette_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study may have brought deep brain stimulation one step closer for the treatment of Tourette syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers reveal that the technique significantly reduced the severity of “tics” in a small group of young adults with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurological condition characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements or uncontrollable vocal outbursts, known as tics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eye blinking, facial grimacing, jerking of the head or shoulders, and repetitive throat-clearing or grunting are some of the most common tics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In more severe cases, people with TS may experience “complex” tics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complex motor tics are synchronized patterns of movement that involve more than one muscle group. For example, a facial grimace combined with a shoulder jerk and a head twist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complex vocal tics may include coprolalia – a term used to describe the vocalization of inappropriate words or phrases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, it is estimated that around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Tourette-Syndrome-Fact-Sheet&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;200,000 people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States have severe TS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Onset of TS is most common in childhood. While symptoms usually improve by late adolescence, around 10 to 15 percent experience debilitating symptoms into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How deep brain stimulation works&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are medications available to help reduce the severity of tics, but they do not work for all people with TS. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new research, however, suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) could be an alternative treatment option for people with TS who do not respond to current therapies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Alon Mogilner, a study co-author who works in the departments of neurosurgery and anesthesiology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York – and his colleagues &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.3171/2016.10.JNS161573&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; their results today in the Journal of Neurosurgery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reach their findings, the researchers enrolled 13 young adults aged between 16 and 33 years who had severe TS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All adults underwent DBS, which involved the surgical insertion of two electrodes into the medial thalamus – a brain region that functions abnormally in people with TS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, participants underwent a second surgery that involved attaching a neurostimulator to the electrodes – a pacemaker-like device that delivers electrical impulses to the medial thalamus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tic severity reduced&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before and after DBS, the team assessed the subjects’ tic severity using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants were followed-up for at least six months and they underwent a number of assessments during this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the first assessment after DBS, the researchers found that participants’ tic severity had been reduced by around 37 percent. By the final assessment, the severity of tics had decreased by 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, in a survey conducted six months after DBS, participants reported that the severity of their TS symptoms had improved “much” or “very much.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, all patients – even those who experienced some complications – said that they would undergo the procedure again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;The survey represents an important aspect of the study because the YGTSS, though a validated scale, may not fully capture the impact of DBS on quality of life for a person with Tourette syndrome,” said Dr. Michael Pourfar, another study co-author who works in the departments of neurosurgery and anesthesiology at NYU Langone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At present, DBS is considered an “investigational” treatment for TS, as it has yet to receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Mogilner and colleagues believe that their findings could change this. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Our study shows that deep brain stimulation is a safe, effective treatment for young adults with severe Tourette syndrome that cannot be managed with current therapies,&quot; said Mogilner. &quot;This treatment has the potential to improve the quality of life for patients who are debilitated through their teenage years and young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Skiing Again After a Stroke</title>

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/040717_ahaskier_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For an extreme skier who jumps out of helicopters and prefers the Alps, a snowy hill in Pennsylvania wouldn’t seem to present much of a challenge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that was before Mark French suffered a debilitating stroke in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So getting back on his skis for the first time in February, even to descend a modest slope, was the greatest “schuss” of all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was a very satisfying milestone,” he said. “My goal is 100 percent recovery and I believe in time I’ll get there.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;French’s goals, however, extend far beyond just his own recovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blindsided by an ailment he knew little about, the 62-year-old executive now wants to use his personal and professional resources to make a difference in stroke awareness and research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In business you need to be able to tell a story,” he said. “All I’m trying to do is share my story in a way that will cause people to think about stroke and what can and should be done.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;French is the founder and chief executive officer of Leading Authorities, a speakers bureau based in Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It has a talent list ranging from political strategist Donna Brazille and former CIA Director Michael Hayden to basketball legend Magic Johnson and Saturday Night Live’s Darrell Hammond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An unexpected event&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 60, French was leading an enviable life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was running a successful business, traveling the world, rising early every morning for a strenuous cardio workout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“From all outward signs, I was in great condition,” he said. “Never smoked, good blood pressure, didn’t have high cholesterol.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;French did have atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat, but it didn’t seem serious enough to him or his doctor to warrant medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But AFib, as it is commonly known, can increase risk of blood clots, stroke and heart problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I couldn’t believe how little I knew about stroke,” he said. “I consider myself a pretty savvy well-read person, but I had no idea what the risk indicators were.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He found out on April 29, 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After hosting a dinner for clients in downtown Washington, French got into his car to drive home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As I put my hands on the steering wheel, I felt what seemed to be an electric current in my left arm,” he said. “Nothing looked familiar. It’s almost miraculous I found my way home.&amp;nbsp; When I got there, my family recognized not everything was right.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;French had an ischemic stroke, a clot blocking blood flow to the brain, then a brain hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was taken to a local hospital, and airlifted a day later to George Washington University Hospital – ironically, across the street from the site of his dinner the previous night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A long road to recovery&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors saved French’s life, but they weren’t optimistic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I had paralysis on my left side,” he said. “They told my wife and daughters I had about 1 percent chance of ever walking again. It was just a cataclysmic change in my life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four weeks in the hospital were followed by six weeks at a rehabilitation hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With determination, hard work “and a very good support network,” French returned to work that fall and has made steady progress since as he continues physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Defying the doctors’ predictions, French walks normally and has resumed traveling. He never had the speech problems that affect some stroke victims, but has difficulty typing (“thank goodness for voice-activated software”).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, he’s trying to tackle the piano.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What could have been a lethal event turned out to be recoverable,” he said.&amp;nbsp; “Stroke isn’t something you recover from the way you recover from a broken bone. You need patience and you need determination. I still have significant deficits, but I have as normal a life as one could hope for under the circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Spreading the word&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that’s not enough. French has spent a career building public awareness, and the battle against stroke needs plenty of that. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I believe that my stroke could have been prevented had I recognized the signs,” he said. “I never ever expected that I would be disabled. Few people do. But this is something that can happen to any more. People need to understand the magnitude of stroke as a leading cause of death and disability.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once he understood that, “What has surprised me is the lack or resources being dedicated to stroke education, rehabilitation and research. It’s a very big deal, and I don’t think it’s being treated like a very big deal. Even in very good medical centers, there’s just not enough in the toolbox.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His group, Leading Authorities, also produces videos and live events.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;French is determined to use his expertise to spread that message. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re in the communication business,” he said. “We’re going to get our message to opinion leaders and decision makers who have some influence. You hear a lot about marvelous breakthroughs in cancer research and that’s great. But we need to hear these things about stroke as well and I want to help.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the two-year anniversary of his stroke nears, French considers himself “extraordinarily lucky” and is grateful for family and friends who were so crucial in his recovery. And as much as he appreciates the Pennsylvania slopes, that’s not the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’d like to ski the Alps again,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/back-on-the-slopes-after-stroke/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;original story&lt;/a&gt; was published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Heart Association News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

;p&gt;What would you rather lose?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your hair or your ability to perform sexually?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may seem like an obvious choice, but some men may be making that decision without even knowing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/670909/?sc=dwhr&amp;amp;xy=10020406&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from Northwestern University has highlighted the need for more information about certain popular drugs targeted at male consumers that inadvertently cause erectile dysfunction and other side effects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers investigated 5α-reductase inhibitors, a class of drug primarily used to treat two conditions in men: androgenetic alopecia (male pattern hair loss) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), otherwise known as an enlarged prostate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neither of these conditions is considered life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hair loss is purely a social status issue while BPH can lead to problems such as frequent urination and bladder control problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finasteride, otherwise known by its trade name, Propecia, and dutasteride (Avodart) are two popular examples of 5α-reductase inhibitors that are commonly prescribed for these conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More serious than reported&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in the Northwestern study say the sexual dysfunction effects of both finasteride and dutasteride are considerably worse than some medical literature suggests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The current Full Prescribing Information (FPI) for finasteride says that, “(t)here is no evidence of increased sexual adverse experiences with increased duration of treatment,” and that “resolution (of sexual adverse experiences) occurred in men who discontinued therapy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers disagree, saying that reporting of adverse sexual issues during clinical trials “was of poor quality” and “systematically biased.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even before any human clinical trials were done, severe sexual dysfunction was a foreseeable consequence of taking finasteride or dutasteride,” Dr. Steven Belknap, research assistant professor of dermatology and medicine at Northwestern and lead author of the study, told Healthline. “If there was meaningful assessment of persistent sexual dysfunction in humans during the clinical development of the these drugs, this does not appear to have been reported in the medical literature, the FPI, or other publicly accessible sources.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Belknap and his colleagues concluded that 5α-reductase inhibitors are not only linked with erectile dysfunction while patients are using the drug, but that these symptoms persist even after stopping usage—a condition referred to as Persistent Erectile Dysfunction (PED).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a pool of almost 12,000 men, 167 (1.4 percent) of them developed PED. The median length of time that the symptom persisted was 1,348 days — almost four years — after they&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;stopped use of the drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also concluded that 5α-reductase inhibitor usage was a more accurate indicator of PED in men than many other well-known predictors of the condition, including smoking, alcohol-usage, high blood pressure, and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Merck, the developer of Propecia, issued the following statement to Healthline:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Nothing is more important to Merck than the safety of our medicines and the people who use them. Merck stands behind the demonstrated safety and efficacy profile of PROPECIA (finasteride), which has been prescribed to millions of men since its FDA approval in the U.S. in 1997. Merck conducted well-designed clinical trials on the product and stands behind the results, which were reported to the FDA and regulatory agencies around the world.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A representative from GlaxoSmithKline, the makers of Avodart, did not respond to a Healthline request for an interview.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A common side effect&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Erectile dysfunction is not an unusual side effect for many commonly prescribed drugs today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everything from anti-depressants, blood pressure medications, and even non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) like aspirin can cause some sexual dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, no one is asking for 5α-reductase inhibitors to be removed from the marketplace. They are effective at their given purpose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers say what is important is that those interested in taking these drugs are getting all the facts about them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For a drug like finasteride, which has existed for over two decades and is estimated to be prescribed to 2.6 million men annually, researchers say that clear and accurate information about its relationship to sexual dysfunction should be more available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.menshealth.com/health/hair-raising-effect&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Men’s Health&lt;/a&gt; reached a similar conclusion in their investigation into finasteride and so-called “post-finasteride syndrome” (PFS). They quoted Dr. Michael Irwig, an endocrinologist at George Washington University as saying “What we do want is for patients and doctors alike to understand the potential risk of persistent problems that may not, in fact, be reversible when you stop this drug.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since that article was published, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated their labeling for finasteride in 2012 to expand on sexual adverse effects of the drug, including erectile dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If we follow the same path in the U.S., we can expect the same result,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of U.S. efforts to protect against the disease domestically, most cases of measles are brought into the country by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/faqs.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;unvaccinated travelers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the speed of global travel, unvaccinated, infected individuals can easily travel from country to country spreading disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Airplanes facilitate the process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A susceptible person could be exposed to a case of measles,” said Lauer, “travel for up to 24 hours, get off the plane, clear security, and not become ill for three to 10 days.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To protect against highly contagious diseases, humans depend on a phenomenon called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The greater the number of vaccinated individuals in a group, the chance a disease is able to spread within that group decreases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The infected unvaccinated person either gets better or dies, and if he doesn't come in contact with another unvaccinated person the virus can't spread,” explained Lauer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the case of a particularly communicable disease like measles, the recommended vaccination rate for a population is 95 percent to achieve herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recent outbreak in Europe has largely cropped up in areas where immunization levels have dipped beneath this threshold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An easy solution&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The answer to the problem remains the same as it’s been for the past 50 years: Vaccination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to WHO, measles vaccinations have &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/measles-vaccine-has-saved-17-million-lives-since-the-year-2000-111215&quot;&gt;saved over 17 million lives&lt;/a&gt; since the year 2000. In order to completely eradicate the disease, countries across the globe will have to focus their efforts on vaccination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to measles, Lauer is blunt: “Prevention is always safer, more effective, and less expensive than treating infection.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As vaccination rates decline and infection rates rise,” he added, “we can expect to see deaths and serious morbidity from measles in the U.S. despite our outstanding care for those who become ill.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/040517_sleepwell_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you toss and turn in bed, awaking every few hours, while your partner slumbers soundly and peacefully?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do you find it impossible to go to sleep before midnight while others you know stumble off to bed and fall deep into dreamland at 10 p.m.?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There may be a biological reason for all this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In two studies released this week, researchers say they have discovered variations in genes that may explain why some people have trouble sleeping and other people are so-called “night owls.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers say, a lot of questions remain unanswered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Discovery of the “sleep gene”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/4/e1602663.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first study&lt;/a&gt; was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In it, researchers focused on genes that change expression in the sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers studied mice and discovered the expression of the gene FABP7 changed during the day in the brains of small rodents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They noticed mice with a “knocked out” FABP7 gene slept more fitfully. The researchers concluded that particular gene is necessary for normal sleep in mammals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also checked the FABP7 gene in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They combed through the data from nearly 300 Japanese men who participated in a sleep study that included DNA analysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 29 of the men, the FABP7 gene did not appear to function properly and those men slept fitfully. The researchers said the men got as much sleep as other participants, but they experienced more waking moments and they didn’t sleep as soundly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, the researchers made transgenic fruit flies, inserting mutated and normal human FABP7 genes into the insects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers said they noticed fitful sleep in the flies that had the mutated gene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sleep must be serving some important function,” Jason Gerstner, PhD, research assistant professor at Washington State University's College of Medicine, and lead author of the paper, said in a press release. “But as scientists we still don't understand what that is. One way to get closer to that is by understanding how it is regulated or what processes exist that are shared across species.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gerstner said other genes are almost certainly involved in the sleep process. He and his team hope to find those biological links, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why people are “night owls”&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second study was published today in the journal Cell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In it, researchers say they have discovered a variant in the gene CRY1 that slows a person’s biological clock.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This so-called “circadian clock” dictates when a person feels sleepy each night and when it’s time to wake up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with the “night owl variant” have a longer circadian cycle, causing them to stay awake later, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For their study, Michael W. Young, PhD, head of The Rockefeller University Laboratory of Genetics, and research associate Alina Patke, collaborated with sleep researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They observed volunteer participants for two weeks in a laboratory apartment that was isolated from any clues as to what time of day it was. Participants were allowed to eat and sleep whenever they wanted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young said most people followed a typical 24-hour sleep/wake cycle. However, one person with &lt;a href=&quot;/health/circadian-rhythm-sleep-disorder&quot;&gt;delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD)&lt;/a&gt; did not follow this pattern.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among other things, the researchers noticed this person’s release of melatonin was delayed. That chemical helps bring on sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Melatonin levels start to rise around 9 or 10 at night in most people,” Young said in a press release. “In this DSPD patient that doesn't happen until 2 or 3 in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When researchers checked the DNA of the DSPD participant, they said the mutation in the CRY1 gene stood out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They said this gene mutation made the CRY1 protein more active, keeping other clock genes switched off for a longer period of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is a fairly impactful genetic change,” said Young.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No small matter&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said sleep abnormalities are nothing to shrug off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone with a “night owl” variant can go to bed later but needs to get up before their body is ready to return to waking status.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/features/dssleep/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;50 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; have a sleep disorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They characterize insufficient sleep as a public health problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young and his team plan further research. Part of that endeavor will be looking for solutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Just finding the cause doesn't immediately fix the problem,” Patke said in a press release. “But it's not inconceivable that one might develop drugs in the future based on this mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, people with sleep disorders can help ease the problem by adhering to strict schedules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young added they can also get strong light exposure during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Are People Being Misdiagnosed with High Blood Pressure?
</title>

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/heart-health/040517_bloodpressure_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your doctor still uses a manual device to check your blood pressure, you risk being misdiagnosed, experts say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could lead to unnecessary treatment with medication for high blood pressure, not to mention dealing with the side effects and expense of those drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a new study published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cfp.ca/content/63/3/e193.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canadian Family Physician&lt;/a&gt;, researchers estimated that about 20 percent of Canadians being treated for high blood pressure, or hypertension, don’t actually need medication because their blood pressure was measured incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers say this is due to more than half of family doctors in Canada still using manual devices to measure blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Automated is the way to go&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measuring someone’s blood pressure manually seems like a fairly straightforward procedure — put on the cuff, inflate it, and read the dial as the cuff deflates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot can go wrong, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It seems like blood pressure is easy to measure, but almost no one does it correctly,” said Dr. Sarah Woolsey, a family physician, and medical director with HealthInsight Utah.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using the wrong size cuff can throw off the numbers. It can also happen if a person is fidgeting while having their blood pressure checked, or checking someone’s blood pressure right after they come into the office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even just being in the doctor’s office can cause a person’s blood pressure to increase. This kind of “white-coat hypertension” is &lt;a href=&quot;http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/62/6/982&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;surprisingly common&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The big message for us is that ‘white-coat hypertension’ is prevalent, and over-treatment may be prevalent and may lead to side effects of medication,” Woolsey told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To avoid these types of errors, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guidelines.hypertension.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canadian Hypertension Education Program Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recommend that doctors use automated blood pressure monitoring in the office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Clinicians should use automatic devices. They are more expensive but more precise because they take several measurements,” Janusz Kaczorowski, PhD, a professor in the Department of Family and Emergency Medicine at Universite de Montreal, and lead author of the Canadian study, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Automated blood pressure monitoring can also be done while the person is alone, which reduces some of the white-coat hypertension. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does that mean manual measurements are always wrong? No, but their accuracy depends on how they’re done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Manual measurement is acceptable if it’s properly done, but that’s often not the case,” said Kaczorowski. “To take blood pressure the right way, a 12- to 15-minute period is required.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may not work with the typical 10-minute visit to a family doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Screening vs. diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/high-blood-pressure-in-adults-screening&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)&lt;/a&gt; offers similar guidelines for blood pressure screening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The blood pressure measurement that happens at a routine doctor’s visit is an initial screening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If someone’s blood pressure is elevated, then a more thorough check is needed to properly diagnose high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can be done in several ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The gold standard is the 24-hour ambulatory monitor,” Woolsey told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If that isn't available, Woolsey said the guidelines “suggest multiple measurements of blood pressure — and they give you the option of an automated office blood pressure, or out-of-office monitoring, or multiple in-office monitoring.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are small, portable machines that measure a person’s blood pressure at regular intervals over 12 to 24 hours. This gives a more accurate picture of a person’s “real” blood pressure level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, these devices may be hard to come by, especially in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent paper published by Woolsey and her colleagues in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jabfm.org/content/30/2/170.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (JABFM)&lt;/a&gt; found that only a quarter of 123 primary care clinics in Utah that responded to a survey had access to ambulatory monitoring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers also discovered that clinics were not following all of the USPSTF guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the high end, 93 percent of the clinics reported using an appropriately sized arm cuff. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But only 57 percent of clinics waited at least five minutes after the patient arrived at the office before checking blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Woolsey thinks the situation may be similar in clinics throughout the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of the lack of ambulatory devices in many areas and the challenges with manual blood pressure monitoring, automated devices may have an even bigger role to play in clinics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We think the automated office blood pressure will be a good solution, especially for our smaller cities and smaller towns,” said Woolsey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Empowering patients&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with high blood pressure often don’t feel sick until their pressure is really high or they develop another problem such as kidney disease, heart attack, or stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s why high blood pressure is known as a “silent killer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/KnowYourNumbers/Monitoring-Your-Blood-Pressure-at-Home_UCM_301874_Article.jsp#.WOTx6hLyt68&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Home blood pressure monitoring&lt;/a&gt; can help people track their condition in between doctor visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can be done using standard manual blood pressure cuffs or automated home devices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For this to work well, though, people need to be properly trained — another area of improvement identified by Woolsey and her colleagues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Slightly more than a third of the Utah clinics provided instructions to people on how to measure blood pressure accurately at home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But once people know how to check their own blood pressure correctly, home monitoring can help them in more ways than one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I personally aspire to a day where we have diabetes without doctors, and hypertension treatment without doctors, because patients are so enabled in self-care,” said Woolsey. “Self-monitoring programs are good for patient engagement and patient self-awareness of their own conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Most Americans Are Afraid to Perform CPR</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/heart-health/040517_CPR_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only half of Americans can be counted on to perform CPR in an emergency, a new survey finds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even more – 61 percent – worry they could unintentionally injure the victim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a concern highest among minorities. About 70 percent of African-Americans, 67 percent of Asians and 64 percent of Hispanics think they could injure the person they are trying to help, compared with 59 percent of Caucasians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hispanics are also more likely than Caucasians to believe special training and certification are required to perform Hands-Only CPR.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Report-2016-HOCPR-Tracking-Study.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016 online survey&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 1,200 adults was commissioned by the American Heart Association (AHA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Hands-Only CPR survey has been conducted since 2009.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A risk worth taking&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Longtime CPR instructor Dr. Gustavo E. Flores, said the findings didn’t surprise him because he’s heard the same concerns and comments from students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he wants people to know the benefits of CPR greatly outweigh the risk of injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your patient in front of you is going through the worst thing that somebody could endure – no signs of life,” said Flores, director and chief instructor at Emergency &amp;amp; Amp; Critical Care Trainings in San Juan, Puerto Rico. “If your patient is in … sudden cardiac arrest, there’s nothing you can do that can make him worse.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each year in the United States, more than 350,000 cardiac arrests occur outside a hospital. Only&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;about 11 percent of those treated by emergency medical services survive, according to AHA statistics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CPR can double or triple a person’s chance of survival, especially if performed within the first few minutes of cardiac arrest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No extensive training needed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flores’ father also taught CPR. As a child, Flores would often accompany his father to classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two decades ago, the hurdle was coming up with safe and effective techniques to pass on to the general public, Flores said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But despite today’s simple technique of pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest, the&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;misconception remains that specialized training is needed, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is safe to do Hands-Only CPR,” Flores said. “All you need is two hands.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emergency medical services training coordinator Sean Culliney teaches CPR in Tucson, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Far more damage comes from doing nothing,” said the paramedic from the Northwest Fire District.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Culliney said the survey shows the CPR community needs to do a better job of spreading the message in minority communities in urban areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;You could be needed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The survey also showed 13 percent of respondents said they had recently been in a situation where they could have performed CPR but didn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s up from 4 percent in the 2014 survey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, 90 percent of respondents support making CPR training mandatory for high school students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another 89 percent know to first call 911 if someone is in cardiac arrest, up from 86 percent in the 2014 survey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through the AHA’s Hands-Only CPR campaign supported by the Anthem Foundation, nearly 6.4 million people have been trained in Hands-Only CPR since 2015 through video education, events, and training kiosks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/many-americans-afraid-to-perform-cpr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;original story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was published on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Heart Association News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

After birth, it becomes challenging to bring children in for repeated clinic visits.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vaccine worked in animals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Newborns are vulnerable to diseases and usually don’t respond well to vaccines because their young immune systems usually mount weak antibody responses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To help solve this problem, the researchers added compounds known as adjuvants that boost the immune system for their experimental vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists used a pneumococcal vaccine because it can cause &lt;a href=&quot;/health/pneumonia&quot;&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/health/meningitis&quot;&gt;meningitis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;/health/sepsis&quot;&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt; that can be fatal to infants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers gave the vaccine to half of a group of rhesus monkeys. The other half was inoculated with an existing pneumococcal vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By day 28, researchers said, the monkeys with the new vaccine had antibody levels from 10 to 100 times higher than the other group. They also were quicker to develop antibody responses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said the experimental vaccine works by stimulating a set of receptors on white blood cells. In particular, they noticed that stimulation of two specific receptors produced the strongest antibody response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They added that the adjuvant was configured chemically with a lipid “tail” that mixes poorly with water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That keeps it from entering the bloodstream where it can cause inflammation or flu-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, the adjuvant stays in the muscle and activates the immune response from there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The importance of the vaccine&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, only the Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), polio, and hepatitis B vaccines are given at birth in most parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The polio and hepatitis vaccines also need multiple doses to be effective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Boston researchers said a one-shot vaccine given at birth could greatly reduce infant mortality around the globe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two experts interviewed by Healthline agree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Chris Nyquist, the medical director of infection prevention and control at Children’s Hospital in Colorado, said a “one and done” vaccine would be beneficial on several levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, she said, the vaccination would be given when a newborn is most vulnerable to illness. The child and their parents also are usually in a medical setting at that juncture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s important to prevent infections as soon as we can,” said Nyquist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cynthia Leifer, PhD, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Cornell University, concurs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The most reliable interaction with medical care is at birth,” she said. “If the findings that they found in nonhuman primates is also true in humans, many more children could be protected by vaccines reducing the global burden of preventable infectious diseases.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Leifer and Nyquist said the possibility of reducing the number of booster shots is important. If the need for a follow-up visit is eliminated, then more children will be protected from disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They added a reduction in the number of shots could soothe fears of some parents about the effects of multiple inoculations on their children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Reducing the number of shots may allay parent fears thereby increasing vaccine coverage and protecting more children,” said Leifer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moms Against Mercury and the World Mercury Project did not provide a representative to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nyquist did suggest that human trials first test the experimental vaccine on adults to judge its safety before trying it out on children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The vulnerability of young children&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two studies released this week highlight the effectiveness of childhood vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2017/03/30/peds.2016-4244?sso=1&amp;amp;sso_redirect_count=1&amp;amp;nfstatus=401&amp;amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR%3a+No+local+token&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) concluded that a flu vaccination significantly reduces a child’s risk of dying from influenza.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists used data from four flu seasons from 2010 to 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They said flu vaccines reduced the risk of flu-associated death by 65 percent in healthy children and by 51 percent among children with underlying high-risk medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far this flu season, the CDC has received 61 reports of children dying from flu-related complications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Maternal-Tdap-Vaccine-Highly-Effective-in-Protecting-Infants-from-Pertussis-Study-Shows.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers concluded that vaccinating pregnant women against &lt;a href=&quot;/health/pertussis&quot;&gt;pertussis&lt;/a&gt; was highly effective in preventing newborns from contracting the life-threatening respiratory illness also known as whooping cough.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists analyzed the records of almost 150,000 infants born at Kaiser Permanente Northern California from 2010 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They said maternal &lt;a href=&quot;/health/new-baby-vaccination-guide/tdap-vaccine&quot;&gt;Tdap&lt;/a&gt; vaccination was 91 percent effective during an infant’s first two months of life and 69 percent effective during a child’s first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/040617_celiacvirus_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition characterized by an intolerance to gluten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Precisely what causes such an intolerance, however, remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers have found that infection with reoviruses might play a role, a finding that might bring us closer to a vaccination against celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, as many as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/celiac-disease/definition-facts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1 in 141 people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States have celiac disease, although the majority of these are unaware that they are affected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The condition is triggered by an abnormal immune response upon consumption of foods containing gluten – a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a person with celiac disease eats gluten, their immune system responds by attacking the lining of the small intestine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can cause digestive symptoms – such as stomach pain and diarrhea – as well as long-term symptoms including fatigue, iron-deficiency anemia, bone or joint pain, migraines, and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At present, the only way to manage celiac disease is to avoid foods containing gluten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the researchers of the new study – including Dr. Terence Dermody, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pennsylvania - say their findings indicate that vaccination against certain viruses could help to prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers published their results today in the journal Science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The link to reoviruses&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dermody and colleagues have long investigated the health implications of reoviruses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are a group of RNA viruses that are associated with gastrointestinal infections but which present no symptoms for most people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the new study, the team set out to determine whether there might be a link between reovirus infection and celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reach their findings, the researchers assessed the effects of two genetically different strains of human reoviruses on immune responses to gluten in mice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team found that one of the strains not only prompted an inflammatory immune response in the rodents, but it also led to the loss of oral tolerance to gluten. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On assessing the immune responses of those with and without celiac disease, the researchers found that those with celiac disease had significantly higher levels of antibodies to reoviruses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the analysis revealed that a higher level of reovirus antibodies was associated with increased expression of the IRF1 gene, which is a key player in the loss of oral tolerance to gluten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study clearly shows that a virus that is not clinically symptomatic can still do bad things to the immune system and set the stage for an autoimmune disorder, and for celiac disease in particular,&quot; said senior study author Dr. Bana Jabri of the Department of Medicine and Pediatrics at the University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘Long-term consequences’ for children&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dermody and team said their findings indicate that an initial reovirus infection may leave a “permanent mark” on the immune system that later triggers an autoimmune response to gluten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could have significant implications for children who are genetically predisposed to celiac disease, the researchers note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, solid foods are normally introduced to babies at around 6 months of age, and these foods often contain gluten.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young children have greater susceptibility to viral infections such as reoviruses. Combined with a high genetic risk of celiac disease, early gluten exposure may fuel its development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;During the first year of life, the immune system is still maturing, so for a child with a particular genetic background, getting a particular virus at that time can leave a kind of scar that then has long-term consequences,&quot; explained Jabri.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;That's why we believe that once we have more studies, we may want to think about whether children at high risk of developing celiac disease should be vaccinated,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The last one refers to an absence of corruption in business and government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norway does have an advantage over some less-happy countries — steady income from oil production and one of the largest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-life-happiness-scandinavia-idUSKBN16R27B&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sovereign wealth funds in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This allows the government to fund programs that help keep Norwegians happy — like its cradle-to-grave assistance programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it may be how Norway handles its wealth that matters most.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even when oil prices sag, Norway is still able to ride it out “by choosing to produce its oil slowly, and investing the proceeds for the future rather than spending them in the present,” says the report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United States, in spite of being known as an economic powerhouse, has dropped in recent years. It landed in the 14th spot this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.N. report cites declining social support and an increase in corruption as eroding America’s happiness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report also offers the United States as “a vivid portrait of a country that is looking for happiness ‘in all the wrong places.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The country’s focus on raising the rate of economic growth — through tax cuts and deregulation — “will increase inequality, social tensions, and the social and economic divide between those with a college degree and those without,” write the authors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mental health drives happiness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s a stark contrast between the top 10 countries and those at the bottom — which includes places like war-torn Syria and the Central African Republic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In spite of that, the report points out that happiness also varies greatly within many countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unemployment and income inequality account for some of these differences, especially in poorer countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in all countries mental health is a stronger factor than physical health for why some citizens are happy and others are not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Western countries like the United States, “diagnosed mental illness emerges as more important than income, employment or physical illness,” write the authors of the report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Max Strom, yoga health and wellbeing teacher and author of the book “&lt;a href=&quot;http://maxstrom.com/store/books/app-happiness-avoid-near-life-experience/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;There is No App for Happiness&lt;/a&gt;,” might agree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The way to really find out if someone is happy is not to ask them on the street with a camera in their face because most likely they’ll not tell you the truth,” said Strom. “The real way is to ask what medications are they are taking.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strom points to the high use of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications by Americans — the United States outranks all other countries on this, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/countries-largest-antidepressant-drug-users-2016-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report by Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his book, Strom talks about how technology gets in the way of real happiness, which he defines as finding meaning in our lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In particular, studies have shown that using &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2016.0259?journalCode=cyber&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;social media can make you unhappy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Instead of being social in person with people, we will go online,” said Strom, “whether it’s on our phone or on some other device.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these relationships lack the non-verbal communication that comes in a face-to-face interaction. Which leaves us wanting more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re starving for intimacy, even though we’re constantly in contact with people,” said Strom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Health spending doesn’t equal health&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research is finding &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/magazine/happiness-stress-heart-disease/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;links between happiness and health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But living in an unhappy country doesn’t always mean being unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take Italy, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It ranked 48th on the U.N.’s World Happiness Report, but it is number one for health on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-20/italy-s-struggling-economy-has-world-s-healthiest-people&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bloomberg Global Health Index&lt;/a&gt; of 163 countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This report looks at variables that include life expectancy, causes of death and health risks such as smoking, obesity and pollution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of Italy’s health success stems from a Mediterranean diet rich in fresh vegetables and fruit, and healthy fats like extra virgin olive oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diet may even trump healthcare spending.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Italy spends only 9 percent of its &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.TOTL.ZS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gross domestic product (GDP)&lt;/a&gt; on healthcare. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United States spends 17 percent of its GDP but ranked 34th on Bloomberg’s list. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is due in part to more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two-thirds&lt;/a&gt; of the adult Americans being overweight or obese, a risk factor for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;America’s fragmented healthcare system may also be depressing the country’s health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://annals.org/aim/article/2609289/survival-comparison-patients-cystic-fibrosis-canada-united-states-population-based&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study published in Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt; found that Canadians with cystic fibrosis can expect to live into their 50s. In the United States, they may only reach their 40s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This inherited disorder affects the lungs, intestines, pancreas and other organs. It has no cure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/upshot/why-cystic-fibrosis-patients-in-canada-outlive-those-in-the-us.html?&amp;amp;_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;According to the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;, Canadians with cystic fibrosis had a similar risk of early death as Americans with private insurance coverage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But compared to people with cystic fibrosis in the United States who had Medicaid, patients in Canada had a 44 percent lower risk of early death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other socioeconomic factors may be involved, but insurance coverage remains a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cff.org/News/News-Archive/2014/Insurance-Coverage-Remains-a-Top-Concern-for-People-with-Cystic-Fibrosis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;top concern for Americans with cystic fibrosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Access to care and life-saving medications — things that people in countries like Canada take for granted — can have a big impact on health, especially with serious and chronic medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/040317_dementiapatients_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trips to the emergency room aren’t usually due to joyous circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet most people find ways to cope with the anxiety of such a visit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But for people with Alzheimer’s or dementia, a visit to the emergency room often devolves into a bout of delirium.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The inability to logically process what’s going on creates an additional layer of concern for the doctors, nurses, and technicians who are caring for these people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I saw this firsthand when my father visited the emergency room with severe stomach pain. It turned out he had pancreatitis due to gallstones. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also has Lewy body dementia, which means he has Parkinson’s-like symptoms well as memory loss. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was admitted to the hospital and from the get-go, it was clear his stay was going to be a challenge for him and for the people who would care for him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He couldn’t answer questions about his pain and within hours of being admitted he was convinced he’d been kidnapped. This lasted for almost his entire stay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The challenge with people with dementia&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;My father’s reaction was textbook, according to Margaret Dean, RN, CS-BC, NP-C, MSN, FAANP, Texas Tech Health Sciences Center, Geriatric Division, and a member of the Alzheimer's Foundation of America's Memory Screening Advisory Board.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, she said, it showed the challenges that healthcare providers face when caring for people with dementia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even simple procedures like taking blood pressure or administering a shot can be confusing or scary to someone with dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They tend to get confused when things are happening so fast,” she told Healthline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 5 million people living in the United States have Alzheimer’s disease. By 2050 that number is expected rise to 16 million.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As modern medicine continues to make advancements and humans live longer, Dean noted that hospitals can expect to see more patients with memory loss disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said in a few years, experts say that by the age of 85 at least 1 in 2 people will have some type of dementia, mainly Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dean believes that the healthcare industry needs to play catch up if wants to properly care for people with these conditions when they come to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said it’s not uncommon for these healthcare workers to have little experience with people with dementia or Alzheimer’s. Her mission is to educate the masses on caring for geriatric patients in general.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Healthcare workers need to learn how to deal with these people, how to talk to them,” she said. “It’s like with pediatrics. You’re not just dealing with the patient; you’re dealing with all of the other people around them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What medical workers should do&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most glaring issues is that dementia or Alzheimer’s doesn’t reveal itself in blood work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nor does it show up on the patient’s face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two diseases also don’t follow a structured path of symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One person may not be able to remember names while another may not remember how to complete simple tasks such as tying their shoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dean said by nature the emergency room is chaotic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At any given time, patients have multiple people completing different tasks. But that environment can only exacerbate the anxiety someone with dementia is experiencing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They do that because they are in a hurry,” she said. “I get that, but they have to limit the amount of things that are going on at once.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthcare providers should also take a moment to reassess their bedside manner when assessing dementia and Alzheimer’s patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you talk to them, speak very simply,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What family members should do&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best advocates for a person with Alzheimer’s or dementia are family members, according to Ruth Drew, MS, LPC, director of Family and Information Services at the Alzheimer’s Association.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Family members need a game plan for when or if a hospital stay in required. First and foremost, all important documents must be copied and readily available. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Advanced directive, power of attorney,” she said. “Like an emergency kit that’s ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secondly, she says that family members need to take a proactive approach, particularly in the early stages of an emergency room visit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think we expect that everyone knows more than we do,” she said. “But not everybody who works in the healthcare field understands the impact of the disease.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s true. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the first night my father was admitted, I had to remind every single person who entered his room that he had dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His Alzheimer’s diagnosis was buried in his electronic file and didn’t pop up as soon as they entered his name into their system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew said it’s important to be specific.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let the nurses, doctors, and technicians know what your family member likes and doesn’t like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe loud noises are too distracting. Maybe they respond better when the nurse speaks close and with constant eye contact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The subtle differences can make a world of difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Be a spokesperson, ask a lot of questions about the medicine, procedures,” she said. “Ask, ‘how can we get this in the chart?’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Training medical personnel&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dean said many of the issues that I faced with my father’s hospital stay could be resolved if geriatrics, including dementia and Alzheimer’s care, were considered mandatory rotations for all healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It needs to be a required track, at the baccalaureate level, grad level, medical school, residency, PT, OT, pharmacy,” she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A rotation would provide proper training in “what to say, what not to say, how to understand where they are at,” she said. “What is their reality, because often their reality isn’t present day.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She mentioned a time she was talking to a someone with Alzheimer’s who was at the nurse’s station, and asked him what year was it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He said 1936. And I asked him, ‘Where are you?’” she said. “He told me ‘I’m on my farm … and I have these mules and these people owe me money.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Welcome to the world of Alzheimer’s,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
t;&lt;p&gt;Antibiotics have been helping us to ward off infections for nearly a century, since the invention of penicillin in 1928.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An increasing number of studies, however, point to the adverse effects of administering penicillin to children early in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, a new study has examined the effect of a low dose of penicillin in late pregnancy and early life on the offspring of mice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Sir Alexander Fleming &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/the-real-story-behind-the-worlds-first-antibiotic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; penicillin - the world’s first antibiotic - in 1928, he revolutionized medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then, penicillin has saved countless lives as the bacteria-killer has been used to fight a wide range of infectious diseases that, until then, were incurable and deadly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, penicillin-based antibiotics are still widely prescribed. In fact, a 2010 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22711728&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; reported that amoxicillin was the most commonly dispensed drug among children around the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recent studies, however, have been expressing concern over the long-term, negative effects of early-life exposure to penicillin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maternal intake of antibiotics has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms15062&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; with a risk of asthma in children. Early-life exposure in offspring has been associated with allergies, obesity, and neurocognitive impairment in late adulthood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton and McMaster University - both in Ontario, Canada - set out to investigate the long-term effects of early-life exposure to penicillin in the offspring of mice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/ncomms15062&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Behavior, gut bacteria, and brain chemistry&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that penicillin had long-lasting effects on offspring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the mice treated with antibiotics showed a lower level of anxiety-like behavior as well as higher levels of social aggression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The antibiotics seemed to affect both sexes equally, altering the gut bacteria and increasing the expression of cytokines in the mice’s frontal cortex. Cytokines help to control the body’s immune response. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the antibiotic was found to alter the integrity of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brainfacts.org/brain-basics/neuroanatomy/articles/2014/blood-brain-barrier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; - a semipermeable membrane barrier that separates the blood circulating in our body from the brain fluid and tissue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. John Bienenstock, director of the Brain-Body Institute at St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton and Distinguished Professor at McMaster University, explains the findings: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In this paper, we report that low-dose penicillin taken late in pregnancy and in early life of mice offspring, changes behavior and the balance of microbes in the gut. While these studies have been performed in mice, they point to popular increasing concerns about the long-term effects of antibiotics. Furthermore, our results suggest that a probiotic might be effective in preventing the detrimental effects of the penicillin.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists discovered that a probiotic supplementation protects against some of these modifications. The &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus rhamnosus JB-1&lt;/em&gt; was found to partially counteract the antibiotics’ effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the researchers concede that the sample size of the analyses for this was quite small, so the positive effects of the probiotic should be validated by further research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Widespread exposure to antibiotics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bienenstock expressed concern over the widespread pediatric use of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are almost no babies in North America that have not received a course of antibiotics in their first year of life,” he told Healthline. “Antibiotics are not only prescribed, but they are also found in meat and dairy products. If mothers are passing along the effects of these drugs to their as yet unborn children or children after birth, this raises further questions about the long-term effects of our society’s consumption of antibiotics.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the near future, the researchers plan to investigate the effects of penicillin on offspring when administered only to pregnant mothers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the scientists hope to counter the negative behavioral effects of antibiotics with the help of beneficial bacteria, so they will test the efficacy of various bacteria in the offspring of mice.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/tech/040317_paralysisresearch_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In autoimmune disorders, malfunctioning immune cells turn against the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cells attack the protective sheaths that surround neurons in the brain, which can eventually lead to a host of symptoms and conditions like paralysis, and in some cases be fatal. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, imagine if these wayward cells could be influenced to control the disease, rather than fuel it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research presented today at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/meetings/spring-2017.html?cid=home_meetings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the American Chemical Society (ACS) shows that it’s possible — and could be a game-changer — when it comes to treating autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Current methods imprecise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While current immunotherapies can yield positive results, they tend to deal in broad strokes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This approach can affect and potentially compromise the entire immune system, rather than dealing with just the cells that are causing problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Christopher Jewell, PhD, associate professor in the bioengineering department at the University of Maryland, and lead researcher on the study released today, told Healthline that his team set out to develop a form of immunotherapy that specifically targeted the problematic cells, leaving the rest of the immune system alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are working on autoimmune disease, where the body’s immune system mistakenly recognizes and attacks its own cells or tissues,” Jewell wrote in an email. “In multiple sclerosis, myelin — the matrix that insulates neurons — gets attacked by malfunctioning immune cells entering the brain. Existing therapies have been beneficial for patients, but are broadly acting, often leaving patients immunocompromised. So the drawbacks are that the therapies are not specific enough. They also require lifelong treatment and don’t cure disease or permanently stop progression.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When good cells go bad&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With autoimmune diseases, an immune cell can falsely recognize a beneficial antigen as a foreign invader. It’s then brought to the lymph nodes, where an immune cell known as a T cell attacks it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the case of MS patients, T cells attack the myelin sheath — the protective shield that surrounds neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of the role the lymph node plays in this process, researchers targeted this area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s in the lymph node that these myelin-specific cells decide how to respond to myelin once they leave the lymph node,” said Jewell. “Our idea was to inject degradable polymer particles directly into lymph nodes that slowly degrade in these tissues to release signals that tell the myelin-specific cells to become regulatory T cells that can control disease, instead of inflammatory T cells that drive disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jewell says these polymer particles are loaded with myelin fragments along with low doses of regulatory drugs in order to change the way the cells respond to myelin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From there, these regulatory, beneficial T cells leave the lymph node and migrate to the brain to control the inflammatory T cells that are attacking the myelin sheath.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The particles are also just large enough to stop them from draining out of the lymph node, meaning the signals are able to not just influence existing cells but also the cells that are developing in the local tissue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We want to try to locally program the function of lymph nodes, but still achieve a selective and system-wide therapeutic effect,” said Jewell. “This is different from other particle-based approaches being tested that involve systemic administration, such as IV, that exposes the entire host to the immunosuppresants and regulatory signals.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Other potential applications&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research team found success with their methods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The particle injections were able to return the power of movement to paralyzed mice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next steps for the researchers include testing their methods on other mice, such as those who have had transplants or type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later this year, they plan to collaborate with clinicians from the University of Maryland School of Medicine to perform tests on nonhuman primates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This next round of testing will provide further insights, says Jewell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mouse models of MS recreate some features of human disease, but they also lack some of the important characteristics,” he said. “So testing in a setting that is closer to humans is important to understand the benefits and limitations of our idea.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If testing goes well, the plan is to eventually use this form of therapy for humans with autoimmune diseases like MS and type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of our goals is to use this unique platform to study lymph node function and how best to promote tolerance, so we’re excited about the new insight we are contributing using intra-lymph node delivery of particles as a tool,” wrote Jewell. “Of course, we also hope to contribute to better options for patients and we are currently working in pre-clinical models of both MS and diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When asked where this technology could be 10 years from now, Jewell said that he hopes it not only leads to improved forms of immunotherapy but also a better understanding of how the lymph node functions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I hope that we’ve been able to use the unique control we have over the lymph node environment to give the field new information about how immune tolerance works,” he wrote. “The more knowledge we have in the field, the better chance we have for scientists and engineers to create more effective and selective treatments to stop autoimmune disease. We will also keep pushing forward on the therapeutic aspects to see if it might be translatable to humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is America Ready for Lab-Grown Meat?</title>

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/food-fads/033017_labmeat_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your next burger or chicken taco may soon come from a lab, not a farm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lab-grown meat, or cultured meat, is gaining popularity and shelf space in American grocery stores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And more brands are on their way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In March, San Francisco-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.memphismeats.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Memphis Meats&lt;/a&gt; announced it had developed the first lab-grown chicken strips in the country. The chicken strips join the brand’s lab-grown meatballs, which they announced in February 2016.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, brands such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://beyondmeat.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beyond Meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.impossiblefoods.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Impossible Foods&lt;/a&gt; have their meat-free, plant-based products in grocery stores and restaurants across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How is meat grown?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like the meatballs, the chicken strips are made with harvested animal cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Memphis Meats must use fetal serum, which is extracted from unborn calves and chicks. Proteins are added to the cells to promote tissue growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A structural support, much like a scaffold, is used to support the growth of the meat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In many cases, the structural support is edible so the company doesn’t have to remove it before a consumer can eat it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skeptical carnivores might be surprised to find that the product is quite similar to animal meat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are developing a new way to produce the delicious meat we’ve always enjoyed, without the need to feed, breed, and slaughter actual animals,” says Memphis Meats’ co-founder and chief executive officer, Dr. Uma Valeti. “We think this is an incredible business opportunity to transform a global industry that is nearing a trillion dollars, and at the same time improve the world.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And even though Memphis Meats’ products aren’t entirely animal-free, in the future, Valeti says the company hopes that will change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to entirely remove the animal from the meat production process,” he says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, the cost of production is prohibitive for the mainstream consumer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2016, Memphis Meats &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-to-serve-up-chicken-strips-cultivated-from-cells-in-lab-1489570202&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; The Wall Street Journal it estimates one pound of chicken costs about $9,000 to produce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compare that to the national average for a pound of conventionally raised chicken, which is slightly more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bls.gov/regions/mid-atlantic/data/AverageRetailFoodAndEnergyPrices_USandMidwest_Table.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$3 per pound&lt;/a&gt;, so Memphis Meats has a lot of work to do if they want their lab-grown product to compete dollar for dollar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We will be working over the next few years to lower the cost of production,” Valeti says. “We’re on a cost curve that is decreasing faster than we had imagined.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company is targeting a 2021 launch date for consumer products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Plant-based meat alternatives&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lab-grown meats aren’t the only new beefy game on the scene.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rise of “bloody” vegetable burgers is giving traditional veggie burgers a run for their money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of patties of mushed-up beans, grains, and vegetables, companies are developing plant-based burgers that are virtually indistinguishable from their cow counterparts in look, aroma, and taste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first one of these meat-like veggie burgers is available now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Beyond Burger from Beyond Meat is made from 100 percent plant proteins and it packs in 20 grams of protein per 4-ounce serving. That’s one gram more than a traditional beef patty of the same size.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The patties are also GMO-free, soy-free, and gluten-free, and have almost half the saturated fat of traditional beef.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many grocery stores will even place the new plant-based patties right alongside traditional patties to persuade consumers to pick up the new product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“An animal is doing the same thing,” Ethan Brown, chief executive officer of Beyond Meat, explained. “They’re taking an enormous amount of plant matter, they’re running it through the digestive system, they’re converting that into muscle or meat. We’re taking plant matter as well, we’re picking the amino acids, fats, minerals, and of course the water, and we’re assembling those in the same architecture to the extent that we can that’s present in meat. My argument is that this really is meat. It’s just meat that’s coming directly from plants, instead of being run through an animal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brown said it’s just a different route along the same path.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The demand for alternative proteins&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Americans aren’t giving up their meat anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, the average American ate 90 pounds of chicken and 55 pounds of beef.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The meat industry in the United States brings in more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meatinstitute.org/index.php?ht=d/sp/i/47465/pid/47465&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$864 billion a year&lt;/a&gt; and employs 6.2 million people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Demand for alternative proteins, however, may still shake up the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Lux Research, the demand for alternative proteins will double by 2024.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That means the global supply chain will need to keep up with the growing demand, and the current animal options may be unable to outpace the animal-free alternatives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consumers are also becoming more aware of the global impact traditional animal meats can have. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Limited resources like water and land may become tapped out as supply grows. Products that don’t need as much water or land may gain the upper hand in the protein fight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;But are Americans ready?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The answer is absolutely “Yes,” if you ask Ethan Brown. “The uptick in consumer interest is unreal. When I started the business in 2009, it was much more of a push where we had to do a lot of convincing to consumers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may be a matter of education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hl-poll&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin: 10px;&quot;&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9712961.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://polldaddy.com/poll/9712961/&quot;&gt;Would you try a burger with lab-grown meat?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think what’s happening is there’s just a large number of Americans that are hearing from multiple sources the benefits of consuming plant-based proteins,” Brown said. “All of these studies are continually coming at people, and then you have an increasing awareness of the role of animal protein in global warming, climate change, and that public psyche continues to occur. We benefit from that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Valeti says the time for his company’s cultured meat is now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In recent polls, a majority of consumers say that they will eat clean meat. We’ve also seen some clear early adopter segments that are ready to buy our products as soon as possible, even at a price premium,” he said. “This is all before we’ve had a meaningful chance to educate consumers on the benefits of clean meat. So, we are certain that the winds are blowing in our favor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When the machine vibrates, it transmits energy to the body causing the muscles to contract and relax multiple times during each second.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The science on WBV is sound. When you vibrate on a platform, the platform causes your muscles to contract almost like you're moving but you’re not,” Pete McCall, adjunct faculty of exercise science at Mesa College in San Diego, Calif., told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For people who are overweight and have difficulty moving, McCall said WBV is a good start. “But like any other form of exercise you’re going to have a finite wall. There will be a point where your body adapts to it and another unit of that exercise isn’t going to provide your body significant benefits,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Still a need for movement&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how much technology makes its way into fitness, the body still needs to move, said McCall. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think of your heart and your circulatory system like the engine in a car, he said. If you leave your car in the backyard for 30 years, it’s going to fall apart, but if you turn it on a few times a month, it will remain drivable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The body is the same way,” McCall explained. “You can't just leave your body sitting in the backyard, so to speak. It will deteriorate. Your heart is like the engine, so when you move, your heart pumps blood around the working muscles. By moving, you’re making your heart more effective at getting blood, oxygen, and nutrients to your muscles.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Karen Lawson, IEEE senior member and senior director of design technology, agreed, pointing to data tracking technology that is widely used to track miles run, steps taken, calories eaten, and more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think Fitbit, Apple Watch, MyFitnessPal, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While technology helps to quantify fitness goals and motivate people to refine their workouts and diet, Lawson said moving is essential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Being a passive participant will still not result in achieving health-related or physique goals without moving the body. Also, it can be discouraging to see the slow pace of results for someone constantly checking in. It confirms there is still no ‘quick fix’ to years of sedentary behavior or poor diet,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The future of fitness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If fitness technology isn't going to exercise for us, what will it do? McCall and Lawson see the future of technology making an impact on fitness in several ways. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fit equals cheaper health insurance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; While McCall and Lawson believe the number of wearable fitness trackers and tracking apps will continue to increase, McCall sees them taking on a different role in health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These are useful for tracking data, but until health insurance companies start giving you a discount based on how active you are on a daily basis, the data we collect on our activity is irrelevant,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He pointed out that some organizations are starting to give employees extra bonuses, credits, or money toward health insurance premiums if the employee achieves a minimal amount of activity per quarter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, the insurance provider UnitedHealthcare has teamed up with the technology company Qualcomm to develop trackers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s already happening. I can see it being common that in order to get the best rates from your health provider you’ll have to upload your tracker information once a month or quarter to show how much you are exercising,” McCall said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart fabrics will get smarter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Over the next decade, Lawson thinks smart fabrics will include sensing capabilities that allow users to augment the monitoring and performance of their activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While such fabrics exist today and are making their way into commercialized products, the cost and durability will only continue to improve and therefore these will be driven into the apparel and accessory market globally,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-home advancements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Our fast-paced lives will drive in-home fitness technology, including the ability to stream workouts from your home, said McCall. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Daily Burn does this with Daily 365. You can be in Chicago and do a live class with an instructor in Manhattan. That type of in-home technology will be big,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The last five years, we had boutique studios like Cross Fit, Orangetheory, and SoulCycle really infringe on traditional health club space, but the next five years, I can see people saying why pay $25 per class at a boutique studio when I can pay that per month for a say, Daily Burn membership and do it at home?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Human interaction trumps technology&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a lot of technology in our lives, McCall believes most people like their exercise as low tech as possible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is kind of saturation point where we just want to go to the gym and work out and forget the downloading and uploading of this and that. It gives us a chance to step away from the screen for an hour or so and maybe connect with friends and those we work out with in the meantime,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Going back to the basics of movement is always a sure thing, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Let's face it, Cross Fit got huge, but it has you run around the block. They've gone to the basics. Instead of buying an $8,000 treadmill, they have you flipping over 300-pound car tires, or instead of being on an expensive elliptical runner, you're doing jump ropes in your garage,” McCall said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, there’s no denying people will continue to seek out tech solutions for exercise, noted Lawson. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But … the trend of changing how fitness is achieved, having more fun, and developing new behaviors around ‘gamification’ of exercise is hopefully resulting in more positive results beyond the body image,” she said. “The holistic benefit of human movement, e.g., experiencing the beauty of a hike, coupled with the technology support to quantify your improved behaviors promises more sustainable health improvements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

t;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is a painful, debilitating autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That makes it a difficult condition to treat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But now, researchers have found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2017/03/22/annrheumdis-2016-210873&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;specific antibodies&lt;/a&gt; in certain people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may provide more treatment options and a better outlook for people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In some — but not all — people with RA, there are antibodies formed that target a protein in joint cartilage called collagen II. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These antibodies often play a role in increasing inflammation in the earlier stages of RA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Potentially better outcomes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past, researchers have concluded that the highest amounts of collagen antibodies are usually detected at the time of an RA diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These levels most often decrease during the first year of RA disease activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a recent study out of Uppsala University in Sweden concluded that antibodies against the cartilage protein collagen II are associated with a good outlook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers said people with RA who have more of these antibodies often do better when it comes to treatments, the management of symptoms, and how disabling their symptoms become.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This study followed a group of people with RA over the course of five years to look at the suspected correlation between collagen antibodies and disease advancement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What they found could prove vital as a prognostic tool and help to further individualize and implement targeted treatments. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Analyzing these antibodies, in combination with other relevant antibodies, could be used for predicting prognosis and choosing therapy for rheumatoid arthritis patients,” Dr. Johan Ronnelid, lead researcher on the study, said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vivek Anand Manivel, a PhD student at the Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, and a lead author of the study, also offered a public statement to the press: “We found that patients with collagen antibodies showed increased signs of inflammation during the first six months after diagnosis, after this there was no difference compared to patients without any collagen antibodies. We also discovered that the presence of collagen antibodies at the time of diagnosis was associated with a better prognosis.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The significance of the research&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What this means for people with RA is that treatments may become better-tailored to them moving forward, depending on the antibody presence and activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RA is a complex disease that manifests itself differently from person to person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since disease activity is so unpredictable, any assistance in figuring out prognosis or a better therapeutic approach could be of importance to the rheumatology community. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In all, our findings suggest that a combined analysis of antibodies against collagen and antibodies against citrullinated peptides could be a new tool for predicting the disease course and perhaps also for choosing therapy in newly diagnosed RA patients,” said Ronnelid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) is often used as an indicator for RA disease activity, alongside rheumatoid factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, doctors can look at the collagen II antibodies as well when determining disease severity and thus, a more robust and detailed plan for treatment and disease management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

lt;p&gt;The typical American diet is the number one cause of deadly and chronic illnesses in this country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the companies that produce some of the food products Americans eat aren’t likely to try to help reduce these serious problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And don’t look for assistance from government agencies and some of our best-known health-related organizations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They have conflicts of interest because they receive funding from the meat, dairy, and pharmaceutical industries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the main premise of a new documentary that premiered online last week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/ondemand/whatthehealth/203617202&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;What The Health&lt;/a&gt;,” which is streaming now on Vimeo, seems to have garnered early attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hour-and-a-half long documentary was the top trending video on Vimeo On Demand in the first few days after its release on Mar. 22.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Filmmaker Kip Andersen was not available this week for an interview, but in press materials he said the documentary “reveals possibly the largest health cover-up of our time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at some of the organizations criticized in Andersen’s film are not impressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They accuse Andersen of cherry-picking studies and ignoring the importance of industry-funded research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s no doubt that poor diet and lack of exercise can lead to various health problems, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes,” Greg Miller, PhD, FACN, chief science officer for the National Dairy Council, told Healthline in an email. “People want to do their best when choosing a healthy diet, but so much information — and misinformation — makes it hard to know who and what to believe. That’s why it’s unfortunate when films such as ‘What the Health’ misrepresent sound nutrition science.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What the documentary entails&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andersen begins his film by discussing how his family medical history got him interested in the topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Like a lot of Americans, I have a family history of diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, so it was important to me to learn more,” Andersen, who co-directed “What the Health” with Keegan Kuhn, said in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andersen proceeds to detail the health hazards of some of the favorite foods in the United States, citing numerous studies along the way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says meat, in particular processed meats, is a major cause of cancer and cardiovascular disease. This includes all meat products from beef to chicken to turkey to even fish. Chicken, he points out, is the top producer of cholesterol in Americans’ diets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andersen, who also made the film “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cowspiracy.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cowspiracy&lt;/a&gt;,” then goes after the dairy industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says the health risks of products such as milk, cheese, and eggs have been underplayed. He states that eggs are pure fat and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andersen then checks the websites of some of the country’s major organizations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says the American Cancer Society has no warning about meat on its site and even has suggested &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/eat-healthy/find-healthy-recipes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; that include processed meat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andersen also finds &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diabetes.org/mfa-recipes/recipes/?referrer=https://www.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; for meat dishes on the American Diabetes Association website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also “heart healthy” &lt;a href=&quot;https://recipes.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; for beef dishes on the American Heart Association website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andersen also notes the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ww5.komen.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Susan G. Komen foundation&lt;/a&gt; has no warning about dairy products on its site even though he quotes research linking dairy products to breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andersen calls each of the organizations for an explanation but does not get answers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He finally lines up an interview with an official at the American Diabetes Association. That interview ends with the official walking out of the room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After feeling stonewalled, Andersen goes online and looks up the funding sources for these various organizations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He finds each of them has a long list of corporate sponsors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Diabetes Association receives support from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.stopdiabetes.com/sponsors/dannon-light-fit-greek.html?loc=stopd-findoutmore?referrer=https://www.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dannon&lt;/a&gt; yogurt, among others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Cancer Society receives support from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tysonfoods.com/we-care/communities/community-projects/washington&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tyson Foods&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Susan G. Komen foundation receives support from &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/kfc-fights-breast-cancer-fried-chicken/story?id=10458830&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kentucky Fried Chicken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.generalmills.com/2014/10/a-new-way-to-help-women-battling-breast-cancer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yoplait&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the American Heart Association receives support from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.progressivecattle.com/news/industry-news/5515-beef-and-heart-health-a-healthy-partnership&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Texas Beef Council&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He adds that the organizations also receive funding from the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andersen points out the federal commission that formulates &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U.S. dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; every five years is filled with members who have received corporate support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the course of the film, Andersen interviews a dozen people in health-related fields including physicians and dietitians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also profiles three people with chronic illnesses near the end of the documentary who are faring better after two weeks of cutting out medications and eating a more plant-based diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The start of a healthy debate?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kurt Mosley, the vice president of strategic alliances for Merritt Hawkins health consultants, said the documentary brings up several important points.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first is the unhealthy aspects of the average American diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think that is key,” Mosley told Healthline. “It’s our fast food diet.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He does disagree with the filmmaker’s contention that eating well is cheaper than eating poorly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I try to eat healthy and it’s expensive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mosley said the potential conflicts between the health organizations and industry are interesting, but he’d like to know exactly what support they’re getting, what percentage of their budget comes from those sources, and who else provides backing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’d like to see what sponsorship is across the board,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mosley said one of the big “takeaways” from the film is the point that many organizations try to help people cope with a disease, as opposed to preventing it either through lifestyle or medical advances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need to cure diseases rather than live with them,” he said. “We need to advise people on how to take better care of themselves.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mosley said this is a prime topic when he discusses poverty’s effect on healthcare with various groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, he said the documentary could serve as an impetus for discussion of all these important issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is really good as a start,” he said. “We have to start the conversation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Criticism, concerns&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Representatives from some of the organizations highlighted in the film are criticizing Andersen’s film for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suzanne Grant, vice president of media relations and issues management at the American Heart Association, said her organization’s recommendations on diet have always followed a “rigorous, systematic review system of the best available scientific information.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said the association’s most recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/circulationaha/129/25_suppl_2/S76.full.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lifestyle guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, for example, recommend that adults follow a diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. It also includes low-fat dairy products, poultry, and fish, and suggests limiting red meat as well as products laden with sugar and salt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the recipes on the association site, Grant said it’s part of the organization’s goal of “meeting people where they are.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A vegan or vegetarian dining pattern is not the dominant one in the U.S. today,” Grant said. “While we recommend that adults who could benefit from lowering their LDL cholesterol or their blood pressure should limit their red meat intake, we also recognize that red meat is a common feature of the American diet, and we urge all Americans to make informed choices to follow the recommended overall heart-healthy dietary pattern noted above if they choose to eat meat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added that nearly 80 percent of the American Heart Association’s revenue comes from sources other than corporations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Grant noted that the association is transparent about the money it receives from industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Financial support from a wide variety of corporations from across the country helps us achieve our goals of improving the cardiovascular health of all Americans and saving more lives,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at the American Cancer Society had a similar reaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They point out they have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/healthy/eat-healthy-get-active/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/common-questions.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;detailed list&lt;/a&gt; of dietary and lifestyle guidelines on their site.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Included in those guidelines are warnings about potential cancer risks with processed meats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials add the nonprofit organization has participated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15644544&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have shown a link between red meat and cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics also noted that Andersen uses only one study to link dairy to breast cancer when there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alicja_Wolk/publication/11450806_Meat_and_dairy_food_consumption_and_breast_cancer_A_pooled_analysis_of_cohort_studies/links/02e7e526eb8b3dd3b6000000.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; concluding there is no link.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Miller, of the National Dairy Council, said the documentary’s statements about healthy eating and dairy foods “are not supported by the science community.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said there are numerous ways to build a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dairy foods, he added, “play an essential role due to their unique set of &lt;a href=&quot;https://dairygood.org/content/2017/is-milk-good-for-you&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nine essential nutrients&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationaldairycouncil.org/content/2016/science-brief-whole-and-reduced-fat-dairy-foods&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emerging research&lt;/a&gt; shows that dairy foods like milk, cheese, and yogurt are associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Miller also dismissed the notion that any research funded by industry is biased.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The assumption that research sponsored by industry which shows a favorable outcome is biased is disappointing to say the least,” said Miller. “What people may not realize is that without funding from industry, high-caliber research may not be possible. By focusing on funding bias, we risk dismissing what are potentially important contributions to scientific literature.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said the dairy council sponsors research at national and international universities that adheres to scientific principles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s important to look beyond the funding acknowledgements and make sure the research is rigorous and not biased toward outcomes to determine how it fits in the totality of science,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So, should we ditch our computers, televisions, and cell phones after dark?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Building on past research&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new study, published in Scientific Reports, concludes that exposure to light at nighttime might not just affect us – it might impact our future children’s health, too. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new findings come from The Ohio State University.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers knew from earlier studies that stressors could cause hormone disruptions in adult mice, altering their physiology and behaviour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also knew from their own previous research that animals exposed to light during dark hours showed a &lt;a href=&quot;http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2011/01/21/rsbl.2010.1108&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reduction in their immune response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, they also found that, by disrupting circadian rhythms – which are daily sleep/wake cycles – dim light at night &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23929553&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increased the body weight&lt;/a&gt; of mice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists – led by Yasmine Cisse, a graduate student, and Randy Nelson, professor and chair of neuroscience at Ohio State’s Wexner Medical Center – set out to build on these earlier results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They designed a study to investigate whether parents could pass these deficits on to their offspring via epigenetic changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Epigenetics describe genetic changes other than alterations in the actual sequence of the DNA; they are changes in the way that genes are expressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, some lifestyle choices, such as smoking, can cause certain sections of DNA to be switched on or off. These changes can then be passed to offspring while maintaining the exact same genetic code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The impact of nocturnal light&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigating how nocturnal light interferes with general health is a difficult task because disturbed sleep can have a negative impact on health, separate from the effects of light exposure at night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is necessary to tease apart the effects of nocturnal illumination and sleep disturbance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To tackle this problem, the team chose to use Siberian hamsters, a naturally nocturnal animal. In this way, they could measure the impact of light exposure during the night without directly affecting their sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team exposed the hamsters (male and female) to two lighting regimes for nine weeks: either a standard light day and dark night cycle, or dim light during the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hamsters were then allowed to mate before being returned to standard light conditions. The next generation of hamsters were all raised in standard light conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon examination, the researchers found that the offspring of parents exposed to a dim light at night did indeed have measurable immune and endocrine impairments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The importance of light pollution&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It appeared that both mothers and fathers independently passed these deficits on to their offspring. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is important, as Nelson explains: “These weren’t problems that developed in utero. They came from the sperm and the egg. It’s much more common to see epigenetic effects from the mothers, but we saw changes passed on from the fathers as well.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cisse says: “This suggests that circadian disruptions can have long-ranging effects in offspring and that’s concerning.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, the hamsters whose parents had been exposed to light at night displayed a reduction in immune response when faced with a foreign substance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also noticed changes in the genetic activity of the spleen: hormone receptors for melatonin and glucocorticoids were reduced in number.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That such a simple intervention could cause a significant response was quite surprising to the researchers. As the authors note: “These data demonstrate that a seemingly innocuous stimulus – dim light exposure at night – is sufficient to induce transgenerational effects on physiology.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nelson believes that “people are beginning to accept that light pollution is serious pollution and it has health consequences that are pretty pronounced – an increase in cancers, depression, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and anxiety disorders.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These findings will need to be replicated in humans, but the message is that the technology that we are surrounded by may be negatively impacting our body’s ability to fight disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/heart-health/033117_princedrummer_THUMB_LARGE.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Bobby Z. bid an emotional farewell to his former bandmate Prince.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His tribute was delivered inside First Avenue, the legendary Minneapolis nightclub where the two musicians performed in the 1984 movie “Purple Rain.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two months later, Bobby came all too close to becoming the subject of a memorial concert himself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six years after suffering his first heart attack, the veteran musician suffered another when a coronary stent in his artery became dislodged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This time, I was lucky to recognize the [heart attack] symptoms,” said Bobby, who was drummer for Prince and The Revolution, which disbanded in 1986. “If I hadn’t been stabilized, it probably would have killed me. This could have been the big one.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rhythms of the heart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For better and worse, Bobby has become almost as well versed in heart attack symptoms as he is in drum rhythms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2010, after experiencing severe pain shooting though his elbows, he suffered his first heart attack, the result of severely blocked arteries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After having three stents inserted and enduring a long recovery process, Bobby became an American Heart Association (AHA) volunteer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also launched his own heart-health awareness charity, My Purple Heart, a twist on the title of the Prince song and the “Purple Rain” movie.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After his first heart attack, Bobby reformed Prince’s old band, The Revolution, to support My Purple Heart with &lt;a href=&quot;http://first-avenue.com/event/2013/03/heartbenefit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Benefit 2 Celebrate Life” concerts&lt;/a&gt; in 2011, 2012 and 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the Purple One didn’t perform at those shows, he was “supportive on every level,” Bobby said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Prince was the first one to call my wife when I was in the hospital. He was a great supporter of my recovery and encouraged me to do the My Purple Heart shows. He gave us the blessing to use The Revolution name and do the shows under the AHA flag,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then suddenly last April, Prince was gone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 57-year-old musical pioneer died at his Minneapolis home of an accidental overdose of the opiod painkiller fentanyl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was an ironic ending since Prince was one of the few rock stars who publicly disavowed all drugs and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“To see the words ‘Prince Dead’ on television was absolutely unfathomable,” Bobby said. “I thought he’d be 99 years old, sitting on a stool, ripping on guitar. I never, ever dreamed he would go at such a young age. It’s a profound loss to the world. He was a living human mystery who would literally perform musical magic in front of your face.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Recognizing the signs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last November – just two months after the Revolution reunited to pay tribute to their late bandleader – Bobby began experiencing mild acid reflux during a child’s birthday party at a friend’s house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That night, the reflux worsened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I instinctively took (nitroglycerin) and an aspirin and knew I had to get to the hospital,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His instincts were spot-on: Nausea, vomiting and digestive conditions such as acid reflux can be warning signs of heart trouble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thanks to his instinctive actions, Bobby was already at the hospital when he suffered a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, he credits cardiologist Dr. Steven Heifetz and the staff of Fairview Southdale Hospital in suburban Minneapolis for saving his life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We thought everything was great, and then the heart attack came out of nowhere,” said Vicki Rivkin, Bobby’s wife. “Bobby takes his health very seriously and he got to that hospital very quickly. It’s important to be safe, don’t hesitate, and call 911 right away.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, after a surgery to insert a newer-model stent, Bobby is doing fine, and he monitors his cholesterol religiously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In 2011, I thought I was good-to-go for life. But it’s an evolving culture in your heart. You’re never really out of the woods,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have very stubborn cholesterol and it seems the plumbing can still get clogged. My message now is that cholesterol numbers that are normal for normal people have to be much lower for people with a heart attack history.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A healthy lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bobby maintains a heart-healthy diet, doesn’t drink alcohol, and exercises several times a week at his local gym. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The stubborn reality of motivating yourself to exercise is the key to survival, the key to having the drugs work and having everything flow the way it should,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My other message is that if you miss your exercise for a week or a month, you shouldn’t punish yourself mentally. You just have to get back on it and not beat yourself up about it.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While he continues to get stronger, Bobby is slowly resuming his musical career.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s planning a series of April concerts by The Revolution at &lt;a href=&quot;https://officialpaisleypark.com/pages/celebration2017&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Celebration 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a four-day event in Minneapolis marking the first anniversary of Prince’s death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s also plotting another AHA “Benefit 2 Celebrate Life” concert for early 2018 before Super Bowl LII, which will be played at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re taking it slow. We’re still grieving and we’re still in a very fragile, strange world without Prince,” Bobby said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But as Prince said, music is like medicine to people. There’s this huge hole, but when you play ‘Purple Rain’ live, you see the look on people’s faces, and you see it really helps. They’ll never get over (his loss), but at least the music helps them deal with it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/revolution-drummer-bobby-z-had-a-heart-attack-soon-after-bidding-farewell-to-prince/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;original story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; was published on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Heart Association News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/032917_fishvenom_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next time you are in pain, you might want to think of a “fanged fish” that lives in the Great Barrier Reef off Australia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The venom from that fish might eventually become a new painkiller that is less addictive than some of the prescription opioids available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The announcement of the fish’s heroin-like venom is the latest in a burgeoning new field of research in which natural toxins from fish and animals are being sought as alternatives on our list of pain medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s definitely a big need for medications like this,” said Dr. Kiran Rajneesh, a neurologist with a specialty in pain management at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, who was not involved in the current study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research findings were published today in the journal Current Biology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The fish in question&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research was led by Bryan Fry, PhD, an associate professor of evolutionary biology, genetics, and molecular biology at the University of Queensland in Australia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fry told Healthline he became interested in the topic because he’s had 24 broken bones during his lifetime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said he’s taken numerous pain medications over the years, becoming addicted to both Vicodin and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthline.com/drugs/hydromorphone/oral-tablet#Highlights1&quot;&gt;hydromorphone&lt;/a&gt; at different times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His current research focused on the fang blenny, an aggressive fish found in the Pacific Ocean, including Australia’s coral reefs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fang blenny injects other fish with an opioid peptide that acts like heroin or morphine. It causes both predators and prey to slow down and become dizzy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The venom is absolutely unique,” Fry said. “We’ve never seen anything like it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Injecting the pure venom into a person would cause similar adverse effects. However, Fry said, researchers can study the venom’s peptides further to see if it could be developed into a new type of pain medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This may reveal versions that are longer lasting, more potent, or with less side effects [than other opioids],” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New field of research&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rajneesh said the idea of using fish venom as a painkiller is quite plausible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He told Healthline there is growing interest in his field in utilizing natural toxins as opposed to those that are chemically produced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said toxins from plants and animals tend to be less addictive, last longer, and have fewer side effects than current pain medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said one of the drawbacks of the natural toxins is that the human body can react negatively to foreign proteins and other substances that enter their realm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The field has had some successes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the best known is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=644300&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;botulinum toxin&lt;/a&gt;, a neurotoxin produced by a bacterium that by itself is the most poisonous known biological substance. However, a purified version of it is used to make Botox.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rajneesh said he uses a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uwmedicine.org/health-library/Pages/tissue-plasminogen-activator-tpa.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)&lt;/a&gt; to treat stroke victims. That medication was derived from a snake venom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s also an experimental drug made from the venom of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/snail-venom-explored-new-pain-medication-article-1.1724101&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sea snail&lt;/a&gt; in Australia that has shown promise as a pain medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve derived some great uses from these substances,” he said. “Nature is really the best designer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fry said these and other discoveries show the importance of preserving the environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is why we must urgently protect all of nature. It is impossible to predict where the next wonder drug will come from,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Older Women With Gum Disease Face Higher Risk of Death

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/womens-health/032917_gumdisease_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have concluded that women who have a history of gum disease or who have lost all of their natural teeth are at a greater risk of death from all causes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists analysed data from more than 57,000 women aged 55 or older to reach their conclusions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Michael J. LaMonte, Ph.D., a study co-author and associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the University at Buffalo in New York, and his colleagues recently published their findings today in the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAMA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), gum disease – also known as periodontal disease – affects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/periodontal_disease/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;47 percent&lt;/a&gt; of adults aged 30 and above in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The risk of gum disease also rises with age. About 70 percent of adults aged 65 and older have the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bad breath, red, swollen, or bleeding gums, and sensitive teeth are common signs of gum disease. The condition is also a key cause of tooth loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 2011 and 2012, almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db197.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;19 percent&lt;/a&gt; of adults aged 65 and older in the U.S. had complete tooth loss, or edentulism, with many cases caused by gum disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Poor dental health and mortality&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href=&quot;http://iai.asm.org/content/early/2015/08/11/IAI.00498-15.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have associated both gum disease and tooth loss with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, LaMonte and colleagues note that these studies have a number of limitations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Few studies have included older adults or specifically women, and in those that have, inconsistent results were reported,” they write.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the team set out to gain a better understanding of how gum disease and tooth loss might impact the risk of CVD and mortality among older women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reach their findings, the researchers analyzed the data of 57,001 women aged between 50 and 89 years who were enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study between 1993 and 1998.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;History of gum disease, tooth loss, and frequency of dental visits were assessed using a follow-up questionnaire, conducted between 1998 and 2003.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over an average 6.7 years of follow-up, the researchers identified 3,589 CVD events and 3,816 deaths among the women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tooth loss may raise death risk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared with women without a history of gum disease, those with a history of the condition were found to have a 12 percent increased risk of death from all causes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This greater risk remained even after accounting for the frequency of visits to the dentist, the team reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the researchers found that women with complete tooth loss had a 17 percent increased risk of all-cause death, compared with women without edentulism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edentulism was most common among women who were older, less educated, and who visited the dentist less frequently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No association was found between gum disease, tooth loss, and risk of CVD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their study is purely observational, so it is unable to establish cause and effect between poor dental health and increased risk of death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, they believe that their results warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Our findings suggest that older women may be at higher risk for death because of their periodontal condition and may benefit from more intensive oral screening measures,&quot; said LaMonte. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;However, studies of interventions aimed at improving periodontal health are needed to determine whether risk of death is lowered among those receiving the intervention compared to those who do not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

od and Drug Administration (FDA) has given people with multiple sclerosis some hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, FDA officials &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm549325.htm&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the agency has approved a new drug to treat adults who have the relapsing form of multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as primary progressive MS (PPMS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the first drug approved for treatment of PPMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, Ocrevus&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.6px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;(ocrelizumab), is an intravenous infusion given by a medical professional.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The approval is especially good news for those with progressive types of MS who have not found a drug that has worked to reduce flares, improve symptoms, or slow disease progression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/MS-FAQ-s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Multiple Sclerosis Society&lt;/a&gt;, 2.3 million people worldwide are living with the disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, for the first time, people with PPMS may benefit from what officials at Roche Pharmaceuticals have called a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roche.com/media/store/releases/med-cor-2016-12-20.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;medical breakthrough&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a large phase III trial, Ocrevus was shown to significantly slow the progression of physical disability in people with PPMS. It was also successful in two large studies at reducing attacks in people with relapsing MS (RMS), according to Roche.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In December 2016, the FDA delayed approval for Ocrevus until this spring due to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/roche-s-ms-med-ocrevus-delayed-by-you-guessed-it-manufacturing-issues&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;manufacturing issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How the drug works&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;MS hits everyone differently, with an array of symptoms and possible progressions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its unique characteristics make finding remedies a challenge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people with MS may respond to one of the injectable disease modifying drugs (DMD) on the market. For others, one of the new oral drugs might work better for limiting attacks, lessening symptoms, and slowing progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there are those people who have tried everything approved by the FDA and still have not found a therapy that slows the progress of the disease and prevents their disabilities from getting worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While several drugs are touted as being effective for RRMS, there had been no approved drugs specifically for PPMS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ocrevus is designed to target the B cells that are responsible for myelin sheath damage and repair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These CD20-positive B cells are a type of immune cell thought to be a key contributor to myelin (nerve cell insulation and support) and axonal (nerve cell) damage, which can result in disability in people with MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;B cells are part of the immune system and so called because they develop in bone marrow and produce antibodies. T cells, the other white blood cells in the immune system, are developed in the thymus gland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Myelin is damaged by certain activation of T cells, which may be affected by B cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve spent nearly the last 25 years of my career in both research labs and clinical development trying to find a novel treatment for MS. Like nearly all other researchers I have been focused on broadly immunomodulatory treatments or T cell directed treatments,” Dr. Hideki Garren, Ph.D., group medical director and clinical science leader at Genentech, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genentech, part of the Roche Group, developed Ocrevus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s new and exciting about Ocrevus is that it is directed to only one component of the immune system, the B cell, which should provide efficacy and safety advantages,” Garren said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Waiting and hoping&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Genentech has an ongoing study to test Ocrevus with various biomarkers that could determine the success of the drug on the patient prior to taking it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FDA extension was the result of the submission of additional data by Genentech regarding the commercial manufacturing process of Ocrevus. The extension is not related to the efficacy or safety of Ocrevus, Genentech said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gene.com/media/press-releases/14648/2016-12-20/fda-extends-review-of-application-for-oc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society are optimistic about the new drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It will be a breakthrough for people living with primary progressive MS, who have waited so long for an effective disease modifying therapy,” said Dr. Bruce Bebo, the organization’s executive vice president of research, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmssociety.org/About-the-Society/News/Detailed-Clinical-Trial-Results-Published-On-Ocrel&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We hope that this success will encourage others to focus more resources into the research and development of treatments for progressive forms of MS.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many patients are also eagerly awaiting the medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hope stays alive,” said MS patient and blogger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://erikasmsblog.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Erika Lopez&lt;/a&gt;, who has now tried every feasible option for her progressive MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Just make it stop. Make the progression stop,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em style=&quot;font-size: 13.6px;&quot;&gt;Editor’s Note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/032917_carbonmonoxide_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sage Wiener has taken care of dozens of people with carbon monoxide poisoning as an emergency medicine doctor in Brooklyn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s relied on oxygen to alleviate the headaches, dizziness, vomiting and other symptoms – a strategy that hasn’t changed much in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Wiener is heartened by new research that shows a protein might help people expel the poison and recover faster, mitigating potential damage to the heart, kidneys and other organs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas produced when fuel isn’t burned completely in furnaces, boilers, engines and other heat-generating sources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When ingested, it chokes off the oxygen supply in the blood. Even relatively low levels of the gas can be harmful for people with cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How the antidote works&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Mark T. Gladwin, a critical care doctor at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and senior author of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/8/368/368ra173&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;December study&lt;/a&gt;, has seen what severe carbon monoxide poisoning can do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His interest in finding an antidote led him to study neuroglobin, a compound belonging to a family of proteins that bind or transport oxygen in the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Neuroglobin was discovered 17 years ago, but Gladwin said scientists don’t know what it does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We make mutations in it to try to understand its function by making it change its function to see what it does,” said Gladwin, chair of the university’s department of medicine and director of the Pittsburgh Heart, Lung, and Blood Vascular Medicine Institute. “And that’s how we stumbled into this idea” that it could help treat carbon monoxide poisoning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He and his fellow investigators changed the protein’s molecular structure to make it powerfully latch on to carbon monoxide and injected it into mice with lethal levels of the gas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gladwin said the mutated neuroglobin worked like a magnet, pulling the toxic gas off oxygen-rich hemoglobin that helps keep our tissues and organs healthy. The mutated protein bound itself 500 times more tightly to carbon monoxide than hemoglobin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gladwin said it only took about 25 seconds for half of the carbon monoxide in the blood to bind to the neuroglobin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By comparison, it takes about 70 minutes for a person with mild poisoning given a breathing treatment of 100 percent oxygen to get rid of half of the noxious gas inhaled, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone with high levels of poisoning treated with oxygen in a high-pressure chamber takes about 20 minutes to get rid of half the carbon monoxide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wiener said most poisons cannot be removed from the body, so being able to target carbon monoxide would be effective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Will it work on humans?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2015, there were 393 deaths from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 50,000 Americans visit an emergency room each year due to accidental carbon monoxide poisoning, research shows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thorsten Burmester, Ph.D., is the researcher who discovered neuroglobin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said the results of the study are important because “the authors developed the first true application” for the protein.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Burmester, a professor at the University of Hamburg in Germany, was surprised the compound could bind to carbon monoxide with such great strength. The findings open up a new field of research, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the verdict is still out on whether the treatment will work in humans, said longtime medical toxicologist Steven Aks, D.O., an emergency medicine physician at Cook County Health &amp;amp; Hospitals System’s Stroger Hospital in Chicago who wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mice in the study were treated immediately after being exposed to carbon monoxide. Yet many people exposed to the gas may not get medical treatment until an hour or more after exposure, Aks said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Really, the next questions are, does it work on a delayed basis and can we get it into people without causing any harm?” Aks said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It will likely be two years before researchers start testing the neuroglobin solution in humans, Gladwin said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until then, experts urge people to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/co/default.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;how to prevent carbon monoxide exposure&lt;/a&gt;, such as never using a gas range or oven to heat the home, never leaving a car running in an enclosed space such as a garage, and installing carbon monoxide detectors in the home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/lab-researchers-create-possible-antidote-for-carbon-monoxide-poisoning/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;original story&lt;/a&gt; was published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Heart Association News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This ailment affects about two-thirds of the world’s population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is the main source for genital herpes. It affects about 11 percent of people around the globe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The HSV-2 strain has been used to help verify the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4844272/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“Out of Africa” theory&lt;/a&gt; that humans began migrating from that continent more than 50,000 years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In general, HSV-1 and HSV-2 are considered cousins and have been thought to have evolved separately.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the researchers of the study took a closer look at the evolution of the herpes virus, building on the work done in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/31/9/2356/2925757/Evolutionary-Origins-of-Human-Herpes-Simplex&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team, led by Sebastien Calvignac-Spencer, PhD, of the Robert Koch Institut in Germany, examined the whole genome sequencing data of 18 HSV-2 isolates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers say they determined the two main lineages of HSV-2 began diversifying about 30,000 years ago. One strain was restricted to Sub-Saharan Africa, while the other spread globally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calvignac-Spencer told Healthline in an email that the HSV-2 strain eventually mixed its genome with the HSV-1 strain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said this mixture did not occur in all HSV-2, but the HSV-2 lineage that spread around the world contains the presence of HSV-1 recombinant fragments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don't know whether there is a causal relationships and these HSV-1 fragments provided a selective advantage to this lineage, but that is clearly one intriguing possibility,” Calvignac-Spencer said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How was the virus spread?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calvignac-Spencer said his team did not investigate how herpes spread from chimps to humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said it’s unclear how the virus moved from one species to another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the reason is that the transmission happened so long ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, he said, there are a number of possible routes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is aggressive interaction between prehistoric humans and apes could have resulted in direct skin contact with blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humans also hunted apes, so the virus could have been transmitted while chimp meat was being butchered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humans could have also consumed food such as fruit wedges contaminated with chimpanzee saliva.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The significance of the research&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calvignac-Spencer said there are several important observations to come out of his team’s research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is that scientists now know that coinfection with HSV-1 and HSV-2 could result in the mixing of genomes, something not considered possible before this study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Since this may have important functional consequences and alter the properties of the virus[es], I think it is clearly a question that warrants some follow-up,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calvignac-Spencer added that his team was able to identify an “ancestral” pre-recombination version of HSV-2.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It turns out it is quite divergent from the ordinary HSV-2. So it might well be that some clinical tests designed to detect the ordinary HSV-2 are not so good at detecting the African HSV-2,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calvignac-Spencer said his team plans to explore these and other issues in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Is Gleevec a Wonder Drug for Cancer Treatment?</title>

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/cancer/032717_gleevac_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s a drug that’s keeping people with chronic myelogenous leukemia alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers are now only scratching the surface of the potential of Gleevec and other drugs like it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before 2001, fewer than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/research/progress/discovery/gleevec&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1 in 3 people&lt;/a&gt; with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) survived more than five years after diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, along came Gleevec.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gleevec is a brand name for imatinib mesylate. It’s a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug as a targeted treatment for CML in 2001.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Treatment for CML hasn’t been the same since. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ohsu.edu/2017/03/08/new-england-journal-of-medicine-publishes-long-term-results-of-gleevecR-for-patients-with-chronic-myeloid-leukemia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10-year follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; showed that 83 percent of people using the drug survived 10 years, some well beyond the decade mark. They did so without unacceptable toxic effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Bharat Shah of Atlanta, Ga., was diagnosed with CML, his life expectancy was between six months and three years. So, he enrolled in a clinical trial for Gleevec. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, 17 years later, he’s still going strong. He told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/cancer-pill-gleevec-keeps-patients-alive-well-decade-n730951&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; that he continues to take the daily pill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from a little puffiness around the eyes, he doesn’t have any other side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When compared with harsher chemotherapy drugs, Gleevec has been shown to produce fewer, milder side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Swallowing a pill is also easier on patients than injections or lengthy infusions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may well turn out to be a transformative treatment for other cancers and other types of diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How Gleevec takes on CML&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Sean Fischer is a medical oncologist and hematologist at &lt;a href=&quot;http://california.providence.org/saint-johns/find-a-doctor/f/fischer-sean-a/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Providence Saint John's Health Center&lt;/a&gt; in California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He calls Gleevec a revolutionary breakthrough for the treatment of CML.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fischer explained that tyrosine kinases are proteins that send signals from the surface of a cell to its nucleus. This is necessary for normal cell function and division. But certain tyrosine kinases are a problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In the case of CML, a tyrosine kinase called the ABL tyrosine kinase, generated by a specific chromosomal abnormality characteristic of CML called the Philadelphia chromosome, is constitutively active, producing the disease,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gleevec, and other drugs like it, inhibit this tyrosine kinase. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These medications have the potential to lead to remission of what was formerly a deadly form of leukemia,” said Fischer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. David S. Snyder, FACP, associate director of the Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cityofhope.org/homepage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;City of Hope&lt;/a&gt; in California, specializes in CML.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s been involved in clinical research of Gleevec and other TKIs for many years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He told Healthline that the recent report published in The New England Journal of Medicine confirms the successful response to Gleevec in the majority of patients with CML. Most achieve a functional cure of CML.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Snyder said there are two points of note.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not all patients respond adequately and may need to be salvaged with more potent second or third generation TKIs [e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/nilotinib/oral-capsule&quot;&gt;nilotinib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/dasatinib/oral-tablet&quot;&gt;dasatinib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/bosutinib/oral-tablet&quot;&gt;bosutinib&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/ponatinib/oral-tablet&quot;&gt;ponatinib&lt;/a&gt;],” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Secondly, there have, fortunately, not been any serious, unexpected late adverse effects observed in patients treated with Gleevec. That contrasts to the experience with other TKIs, which have been associated with serious thromboembolic events, especially ponatinib, but also nilotinib and dasatinib, pleural effusions, and other cardiac effects,” Snyder continued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Potential in treating other cancers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research indicates that imatinib is also effective in treating other cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This includes some forms of &lt;a href=&quot;/health/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia-all&quot;&gt;acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)&lt;/a&gt; in children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Snyder, Gleevec targets the pathogenic driver of CML. But that’s not all it does. It also inhibits other tyrosine kinases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That makes it useful in treating other malignancies. These include chronic eosinophilic leukemia and &lt;a href=&quot;/health/gist&quot;&gt;gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Other tumors that are driven by targetable tyrosine kinases may also be treatable with Gleevec,” said Snyder. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also noted there are many other TKIs in development, or already approved, to treat some of these diseases, including a subset of lung cancers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are over 90 known tyrosine kinases in humans,” Snyder explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Other diseases&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Snyder said there have been some other unexpected, potentially beneficial effects noted for Gleevec. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For example, Gleevec &lt;a href=&quot;http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/65/4/829&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;may help improve&lt;/a&gt; control of type 2 diabetes in some patients, perhaps by decreasing insulin resistance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Fischer, there is a focus on using this type of drug to combat nonmalignant disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nilotinib, which is a TKI similar to Gleevec, is also used to treat CML. It was found to affect activity in Parkinson’s disease, a neurologic movement disorder. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This exciting discovery has prompted additional research to fully assess this medication’s potential impact in Parkinson’s disease. Alzheimer’s, another progressive neurologic condition producing dementia, has also been quite topical,” said Fischer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said that’s due to discovery of gene mutation in certain older adults. It may protect them from developing Alzheimer’s dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/114/6/1389.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Gleevec was noted to mimic the effects of the protective mutation. This observation has served as a model for further study and development of such drugs to fight Alzheimer’s dementia,” said Fischer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The platform for targeted therapy to treat nonmalignant conditions continues to evolve. The potential for breakthroughs is extremely exciting,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Previous studies looking at marathon running and its impact on health have uncovered a number of potential health risks associated with the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22160404&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2012 concluded that endurance training, including marathons, caused dysfunction in the right ventricle of the heart. Similarly, marathon- runners have been shown to have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538475/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fivefold&lt;/a&gt; increased risk of atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some researchers theorize that running marathons might also damage the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier work has shown that particularly vigorous activities – including harvesting sugar cane, mining work, and military training – can damage the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, until now, marathon running’s impact on kidney health has not been studied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent study set out to specifically examine the impact of running marathons on kidney health. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(17)30536-X/fulltext&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; were published today in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Chirag Parikh, who is a professor of medicine, led a team of researchers from Yale University. Participants were all runners from the 2015 Hartford Marathon, which takes place in Connecticut.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before and after the race, the scientists took blood and urine samples, which they analyzed for markers of kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, they checked for protein in the urine and creatinine levels in blood serum - a marker of reduced kidney function. They also examined kidney cells under a microscope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In all, 82 percent of the runners in the study showed stage 1 acute kidney injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The dangers of kidney injury&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Acute kidney injury, as described by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/AcuteKidneyInjury&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Kidney Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, is a “sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage that happens within a few hours or a few days.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It causes waste products to build up in the blood, making it hard for kidneys to maintain the correct balance of fluids in the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parikh explains the results: “The kidney responds to the physical stress of marathon running as if it's injured, in a way that's similar to what happens in hospitalized patients when the kidney is affected by medical and surgical complications.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why does marathon running damage the kidneys in this way?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that there could be a number of factors involved, including dehydration, a rise in core temperature, and a drop in blood flow to the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the drop in kidney function was significant, they also found that within two days, the kidney injury had resolved. However, more work needs to be done to understand whether this type of strenuous activity could cause long-term damage over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In conclusion, Parikh said: “Research has shown there are also changes in heart function associated with marathon running. Our study adds to the story - even the kidney responds to marathon-related stress.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is important to note that exercise, in general, is a healthy life choice. However, evidence is mounting that excessive, particularly strenuous activity should be undertaken with caution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
&gt;President Trump may turn out to be right on this one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Friday, the president said the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare, was going to “explode.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He repeated that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/03/25/do-not-worry-trump-tweets-obamacare-explode/99617506/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prediction&lt;/a&gt; in a tweet on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And on Monday, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, reiterated the expectation, saying Obamacare was “&lt;a href=&quot;http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/27/spicer-repeal-isnt-dead-obamacare-is-dying-on-its-own-video/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dying on its own&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They made the statements in response to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/24/obamacare-replacement-vote-postponed-in-house-as-gop-fails-to-win-support.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;failure&lt;/a&gt; of Republican leaders in the House of Representatives last week to approve a plan to “replace and repeal” Obamacare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts interviewed by Healthline said the ACA may indeed start to unravel later this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In part, they said, because Obamacare was headed for trouble anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s also because the Trump administration might not do much to help the healthcare system and, in fact, can do things to help push it over the cliff even sooner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what happens if the ACA does collapse?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be chaos,” Kurt Mosley, vice president of strategic alliances at Merritt Hawkins health consultants, told Healthline. “There has to be some kind of life support for the current system until a new plan is passed.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twila Brase, president of the Citizens’ Council for Health Freedom, had a similar but slightly less pessimistic view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think Obamacare as we know it will implode,” Brase told Healthline. “However, that doesn’t mean the health system will implode.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Will they sabotage?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obamacare was facing a number of obstacles already this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first was that several large insurance firms, among them &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/unitedhealthcare-bails-out-of-obamacare&quot;&gt;UnitedHealthcare&lt;/a&gt;, had already significantly cut back on their participation in the state marketplaces that sell health insurance under the auspices of the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That has left about one-third of the counties in the United States with only one insurer in these marketplaces, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/2017-premium-changes-and-insurer-participation-in-the-affordable-care-acts-health-insurance-marketplaces/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ACA system is also having trouble getting younger, healthier people to sign up. The tax penalties imposed on people who don’t have health insurance haven’t been high enough to motivate those younger folks to enroll.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite these problems, Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, said Obamacare will remain healthy if it is allowed to move forward unimpeded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think [the implosion] is purely wishful thinking on the part of the president,” Pollack told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, he acknowledged there are a number of things the White House can do to sabotage Obamacare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It really is a question of what is the intent of the administration,” said Pollack. “It’s hard not to take [the president’s comments] as a signal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing the White House has already done is &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/01/22/trump-health-insurance-mandate/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;relax enforcement&lt;/a&gt; of the tax penalties for people without insurance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is likely to encourage even fewer younger, healthier people to sign up. Without their participation, it’s difficult for insurance companies to balance the costs of insuring older participants and less healthy customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unless young people sign up for this, I don’t see how it works,” said Mosley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other thing the White House has already done is not promote the open enrollment periods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In late January, the Trump administration &lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/27/news/economy/obamacare-ads-trump/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pulled the ads&lt;/a&gt; for Obamacare a couple weeks before this year’s enrollment period ended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/03/more-than-9-million-people-signed-up-on-federal-obamacare-exchange-by-close-of-open-enrollment-government-says.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9.2 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; signed up for insurance plans on healthcare.gov, which serves 39 states. If state-run exchanges are included, Obamacare enrollment rises to 12 million. That’s still about half a million fewer enrollees than last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration could decide to forgo advertisements for the entire 2018 enrollment period, which begins on Nov. 1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There won’t be as much pressure on people to sign up then,” Brase noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Other ways to sabotage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a number of other things the White House can do to help derail the ACA, if it chooses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is to cut the cost-sharing subsidies that help people pay the premiums on the insurance they purchase on the marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That could be done in the upcoming budget process for the next fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mosley said that could send premiums to unaffordable levels, especially for people with chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The cost would be out of reach for a lot of people,” Mosley said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That would discourage a lot of people from staying in the marketplace,” added Pollack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The White House could also decide not to defend the ACA against lawsuits filed against it, something the Obama administration steadfastly did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a new sheriff in town. They could decide they’re not going to do it,” said Mosley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experts said that would allow opponents to continue to chip away at the healthcare law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s also the question of Medicaid expansion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the ACA was enacted in 2010, 31 states and the District of Columbia have opted to expand Medicaid for low-income households and receive federal funds to help administer the program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mosley said a number of states were considering joining that expansion this year when it appeared Democrat Hillary Clinton was going to win the presidency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, with President Trump in the White House, he says that’s unlikely to happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think talk of anybody expanding is dead right now,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to expect&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the worst case scenario arrives and Obamacare collapses at year’s end, what is the fallout?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experts don’t paint a pretty picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That could cause real problems,” said Pollack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experts see more people without insurance coverage and higher premiums for those who buy plans in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mosley said more insurance companies might decide to walk away from the marketplaces. Others will simply stand on the sidelines to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They’ll have their finger in the wind,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pollack adds that the 155 million Americans who have health insurance through their employers might also be impacted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said companies could decide to cut back on coverage or continue to offer plans with high deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brase, however, said there may be a silver lining in all this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said states may decide to take more control over their health insurance plans. They are being given more leeway on how they implement the ACA under the act’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/cciio/programs-and-initiatives/state-innovation-waivers/section_1332_state_innovation_waivers-.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Section 1332&lt;/a&gt;, which takes effect this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They should be doing this anyway,” she said. “This could be the beginning of things heading in the right direction.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever happens, the experts agree that what the Trump administration does or doesn’t do will probably make or break Obamacare during the next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t believe Congress can do anything to prevent the implosion,” said Brase. “Whatever the administration does — that will be the difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
’re living longer these days, but that hasn’t stopped newer branches of medicine from trying to enhance and further extend our lifespans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in longevity medicine and biogerontology are studying drugs and compounds that can prevent and reverse aging on the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Over the past few years, public interest in longevity issues has grown, but that interest is mostly in health-extending therapies, not simply life-extending therapies. Most people are interested in living longer, but only if they can also be healthier longer,” Sonia Arrison, author of “100 Plus: How the Coming Age of Longevity Will Change Everything, From Careers and Relationships to Family and Faith,” and founder of Singularity University in California, told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many people are focused on lifestyle changes, the addition of drugs — rapamycin and &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/metformin/oral-tablet#Highlights1&quot;&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt; are two that Arrison mentioned — gives humans more options to extend their lives as well as the quality of their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared with preventative drugs such as statins to avoid having a heart attack, anti-aging drugs fight multiple diseases at once instead of focusing on one ailment, Arrison added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A person who goes by the name Reason, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rationalargumentator.com/index/blog/tag/fight-aging/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;technologist&lt;/a&gt; and author on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2011/05/on-the-topic-of-my-name/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FightAging.org&lt;/a&gt;, which highlights health- and longevity-enhancing medical technologies, told Healthline that the drugs are targeting a wide range of age-related ailments and diseases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All age-related diseases are age-related because they are caused by the processes of aging, which is to say an accumulation of damage in cells and tissues,” Reason wrote in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Understanding longevity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The field of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3555024/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;geroprotection&lt;/a&gt; involves understanding cell senescence, which is when cells stop dividing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When senescent cells no longer divide, they stop functioning, so organ health deteriorates. Cell senescence also causes the release of proinflammatory cytokines, which damage tissues. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This arena involves the use of geroprotectors, which are compounds that can stop or reverse cellular aging, and senolytics, which are compounds that can pinpoint and destroy senescent cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is why researchers are looking into geroprotectors and senolytics, which requires long spans of time to understand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In essence, today’s researchers may never see the outcomes of the research they’ve started because it can take decades to study. Nevertheless, scientists continue to try to understand these compounds and how they can alter our cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into our cell’s telomeres, which are short segments of DNA in our chromosomes that protect cells from wear and tear that comes with aging. As cells divide, they can shorten and no longer protect the chromosome or cell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lengthening them is the focus of recent research. Last year, a BGRF &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-04/brf-fgt042116.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was able to lengthen &lt;a href=&quot;https://bioviva-science.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;human telomeres&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/molecule-kills-elderly-cells-reduces-signs-aging-mice&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent report&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(17)30246-5?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867417302465%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt; detailed how peptides were able to boost the life span of mice. The study examined how cell therapy could reverse poor age-related kidney function, fur loss, and frailty in mice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists are looking into whether or not the approach can also prolong the life span of mice. Human safety studies are in the works. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reason said there are two schools of thought when exploring extending life through genetic pathways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One approach is to alter cellular metabolism and make cells age more slowly, but the work is difficult and expensive. The other is to fix old tissue because we understand how it compares with young tissue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No one yet fully understands everything these [older] cells do to us, but the fastest way to find out is to get rid of them, and we know that doing that in mice extends life and reverts aspects of aging,” Reason explained. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Either you slow down the damage, or you repair the damage. Aging is damage. It is in the ‘how’ of achieving one of those goals that all the complexity starts up,” Reason added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Documenting anti-aging compounds&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Human Aging Genomic Resources (HAGR) website recently released DrugAge, a database of lifespan-extending drugs and compounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It includes 418 compounds that were recorded from studies on 27 different model organisms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HAGR already operates the GenAge database of age and longevity-related genes in humans and model organisms. They also operate AnAge, which has aging and longevity records of more than 4,000 species, the GenDR database of genes associated with the life-extending effects of dietary restriction, and LongevityMap, which includes more than 2,000 human gene and genetic variations linked to longevity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DrugAge incorporates &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aging-us.com/article/100799&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;earlier efforts&lt;/a&gt; by Biogerontology Research Foundation (BGRF) scientists, who produced &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geroprotectors.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Geroprotectors.org&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, it’s the largest database of its kind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the research teams from BGRF and the University of Liverpool, pharmaceuticals have not targeted most age-related pathways. The research is only focused on a small number of pathways that are currently known.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal behind the database is to pave the way for discovery of new life span-extending and health span-extending compounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I am confident that it [DrugAge] will gain widespread use in the aging research community, and represents a significant milestone along the way to the coming paradigm shift in modern healthcare away from single disease treatment and toward geroprotective multi-disease prevention,” Dmitry Kaminskiy, managing trustee of BGRF, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Franco Cortese, deputy director and trustee of BGRF, said in a statement the database will be “extremely valuable” for biogerontologists. The BGRF did not respond to Healthline’s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Already, researchers are using the data to identify trends and develop a better understanding of the comparative effects of geroprotectors on organisms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arrison is excited when she sees people teaming up globally to battle human disease and decline — something that the DrugAge team is hoping to do with their database. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The more knowledge the health community can get, the better. The wonderful thing about the internet is that knowledge gets distributed faster, making the quest for cures that much quicker,” Arrison added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Ray and Wu majored in business and finance, Shiue in industrial design.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company they founded, mPort, has partnered with LA Fitness to install 670 units in its clubs in the United States. Following the initial rollout in Orange County, Calif., the company is now installing mPods in other cities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mPod user steps into a photo booth-sized pod and stands still in one place while several sensors capture highly accurate body data without the user having to move. In a few minutes, the scanner produces a 3-D image that shows real-time changes achieved through different diets and fitness regimens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The mPod is 100 percent automated,” Mehul Dave, mPort’s chief marketing officer, told Healthline. “The user does not require another person to help them. You interact only with the machine. The mPod has an audio, visual, and touch interface. It talks to you and you talk back with your hands.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mPod uses noninvasive infrared technology, equivalent to what comes out of a television remote control, and is safe to use for everyone including pregnant women, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The unit maps more than 200,000 data points to measure your individual body shape,” Dave added. “Then it sends the information to the mPod mobile app, creates a 3-D image, or avatar, with data on all body and health measurements, and what they mean. It also describes the levels of risk you face.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mPod records height, weight, biceps, chest, narrow waist, hips, mid-thigh, knees, calves, shoulders, and neck. It also measures BMI, body fat percentage, fat-free mass and percentage, waist-hip ratio, waist-height ratio, basal metabolic rate, ideal weight range, and target heart rate for exercise. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dave and his colleagues finished their prototype in May 2013, and attracted investors four months later. By June 2016, they had signed the contract with LA Fitness clubs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Seeing the changes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mPort focus is direct use by the customer in a shopping center or a club.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mPod design offers security and comfort in a public place, Dave said. The app extends the usefulness of the scan by allowing users to access and use their data anytime to pursue health and fitness goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While mPort’s founders first conceived of their scanner as a way for users to measure themselves before buying clothing online, Greg Moore — the founder and chief executive officer of Fit3D in Redwood City, Calif., and creator of the ProScanner — was inspired by his mother, Lynne.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with Healthline, Moore said, “After trying for several years to shed some unwanted pounds, my mother hired a trainer and a nutritionist and started on a very healthy lifestyle. She mixed healthy eating with high-intensity interval training and cardio exercises. She was building muscle while shedding fat. So when I'd see her every few months, I could see that she fit inside of her old body.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lynne became increasingly demotivated because her weight seemed to change so minutely, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a background in fitness, he knew her body was getting more lean and dense, but she didn't have a way to evaluate her progress. She finally gave up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A computer engineer, Moore was a member of the invention team at Sportvision, which provides data and analytics for MLB teams. He drew on that experience, beginning in 2010, “to solve my mom’s problem with motivation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fit3D ProScanner user stands on a raised circular platform that makes one 360-degree rotation while an infrared camera on a nearby aluminum stand records information and relays it to a connected laptop.&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ProScanner captures about 1,200 “depth” images on a body and combines them to create a full 3-D avatar of a human body, Moore said. The unit extracts more than 350 of those measurements to produce proprietary and university research-backed wellness metrics. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The data is finally presented to users and their coaches through the cloud-based Fit3D web platform,” Moore said. “Users can see scans and stats, compare them to past scans, and see a crazy amount of data about their bodies.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fit3D sells, leases, or rents ProScanners to a spectrum of businesses to enhance their customer experience, Moore said. Clients include health insurance companies, hospitals, health clubs, weight loss centers, fashion brand shops, and custom-made men’s suit shops. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moore said user feedback has helped to improve the ProScanner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Do 3-D images help someone lose weight?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;James Shapiro, a certified personal trainer and president of New York City-based Primal Power Fitness, has watched the tech boom in fitness over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I've seen how impactful wearable tech has been for data tracking,” he told Healthline. “But this turn into 3-D body scanning is incredible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I try to create a blueprint for someone, I want to know every possible detail,” he added. “This boils down to nutrition, sleep habits, hydration levels, stress levels, and more. These small variables matter because it can be the difference of a couple points of body fat, or levels of performance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clients benefit from the wealth of recorded scan data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Having these small details in a physical representation offers a picture the client can believe in and understand when it comes to body composition,” Shapiro said. “A scan removes the margin of error that bio-electric impedance tests [which measure body fat in relation to lean body mass] have, and that has significant reliability. On a larger commercial scale, scans can be the best thing that can happen to personal training.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although Shapiro and his colleagues have no experience yet with 3-D scanning, he has a keen interest in the technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you want to deliver a quality service, you want to provide the best information to back up your statements or claims,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hl-poll&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin: 10px;&quot;&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9704800.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://polldaddy.com/poll/9704800/&quot;&gt;Would a 3-D body scanner help you lose weight?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This would be more important for his clients who wish to considerably improve body composition and would benefit from the detailed 3-D images, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A scan would offer a significant physiological boost to clients, who would be able to see that their sweat and tears were showing concrete results,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shapiro said the only real drawback to 3-D scanning would be that either the trainer or the client could misinterpret the information and believe they could achieve “spot” reduction. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Spot reduction is the belief that you can reduce a specific area of the body through extensively training only that part,” he said. “This might lead to unclear expectations and loss of motivation due to a lack of results.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/032717_adoption_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just adopt.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those same two words were thrown at me relentlessly after my infertility diagnosis at the age of 26.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was young and single, and from an outsider’s perspective I’m sure it made sense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Why worry about this now? Wait until you settle down. Then … just adopt.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The words came from a place of caring. But every time I heard them, it stung a little bit more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The truth was, I wasn’t ready to accept adoption as my path in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had always wanted to be a mother, but I’d always pictured that coming to me in the same way it did for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I believed I would fall in love, get married, get pregnant, and be able to care for my child from the moment of conception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once I felt those choices being ripped away from me, adoption began to feel like the scraps I was left with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the more people offered it up to me as the seemingly easy solution, the more I resented the idea that I should just accept this second-rate path to parenthood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because yes, at the height of my infertility grief, that was how I began to view adoption. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m not proud. But I was so angry. And sad. And hurt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why did everyone around me get to just snap their fingers and be pregnant, while I was essentially being told to simply take what I could get and be grateful for it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A change of heart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It took years for me to get past that feeling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I pursued fertility treatments on my own, determined to at least give my body a chance at carrying a baby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it didn’t work, I took a step back and told myself I would wait.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wait until I fell in love. Wait until I had my partner. Wait until something else felt like the right step to take.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I didn’t move closer to adoption. I just moved further away from the tight grip I was holding on what parenthood should look like for me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in the years that followed, I worked on healing both my body and my heart. I gave myself permission to not have all the answers. I took the pressure off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, something happened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About five months’ shy of my 30th birthday, a friend sent me a link to a profile of a little girl on a foster to adopt website.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t know why,” she said, “But I saw her and just thought of you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hadn’t thought any further about adoption at all in the years prior. And I certainly hadn’t thought about fostering or adopting an older child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But something clicked as I looked not only at this little girl’s profile, but also at the profiles of other children like her looking for homes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It no longer felt like second best. Suddenly, it felt like everything I’d been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A sudden change in plans&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;My heart opened to adoption almost overnight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I began to believe adopting an older child through foster care was something I was meant to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I started classes for my foster care certification almost immediately, and I was getting truly excited about the prospect of skipping those sleepless baby years and instead bringing a child into my life who might otherwise never find a place of their own to call home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A child who might really, truly need me. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life had other plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just three months after that first profile was sent to me, and on the day of my last foster care certification class, I found myself in a delivery room holding the newborn who would become my daughter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d met her other mother by chance just the week before, as she had been frantically looking for someone to take the baby she was still carrying. The details of our adoption story are incredibly unique, but four years later I can say with certainty … it was all very much so meant to be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have an extremely open adoption, and I am routinely thankful for the connections we have been able to maintain with my daughter’s other family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am also so in love with this little girl, to the point that I can’t believe I ever thought, even for a second, that adopting might be a lesser way of becoming a parent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A long, emotional road&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But hindsight is always 20/20.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing you will never hear me telling a woman who is struggling with infertility to do is to “just adopt.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that adoption has to be a calling for it to work. You have to want it, not because you can’t have anything else, but because it’s where your heart is actually leading you. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I also know from experience that just because you’re not there now, doesn’t mean you never will be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthline spoke to Lori Holden, author of “The Open-Hearted Way to Open Adoption,” and she shared a similar sentiment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Adoption is too big a deal to enter into with anything but full intentionality,” she explained. “There are just too many issues that can come up along the way that can be too difficult to deal with if it’s not something your heart is in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which is why it can be important to come to a place of peace with infertility first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Filling the crib isn’t the same thing as resolving infertility.” Holden said. “Becoming a mom or dad through adoption resolves the parenthood issue, but still, we remain incapable of conceiving and bearing a child with our and our beloved’s DNA. This can show up over the years when we realize on occasion that we have a child with an unfamiliar-to-us temperament or interest or skill set. We may notice it when our child’s expression reminds us of a birth parent.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These flashes can trigger feelings of jealousy or sadness or insecurity. “She looks too much like her and nothing like me.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In those moments, we may feel left out, resentful, diminished. Will we allow these emotions to cause us to react from a hurt place? Or will we take a moment to understand what is going on inside us and choose how we respond to our emotions?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am personally of the belief that until you are at a place of peace with infertility, dealing with those emotions that go hand in hand with adoption in a healthy way is nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How long should you wait?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acf.hhs.gov/hlcmsresource/cb/afcarsreport23.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;federal government statistics&lt;/a&gt;, there are about 427,000 children in foster care with an average age of 8.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also about 111,000 children waiting to be adopted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, clearly the need is there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But how long should a person still grieving infertility wait before pursuing adoption?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holden told Healthline, “I’ve found that grief tends to come in a spiral rather than a linear fashion. It may be unrealistic to wait until all grief is resolved — does that ever even happen? But there is a sense of acceptance that eventually comes if we allow our feelings to be felt and maybe even released. The spiral does tend to lessen in intensity over time. With the help of a good therapist, and with the intention to deal with feelings of grief when they do spiral around each time, we can get to a place of acceptance of infertility and excitement about adoption as a path toward parenthood.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reaching that point is different for everyone, and some may never fully get there. That’s OK, too. Adoption isn’t for everyone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the several adoptive parents Healthline spoke to, there were a lot of different responses regarding when to move on to adoption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sarah Allen of Australia, and Amber Mary of Alaska, both said they wished they hadn’t wasted so many years (and so much money) on fertility treatments and had instead moved on to adoption sooner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Kim Freitas echoed some of my own sentiments, saying, “I don’t think I could have closed the infertility chapter of my life without trying IVF. That was my closure, so to speak.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I personally needed to try. I needed to check those boxes and to be able to walk away from the dream of pregnancy knowing I had at least given it a shot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I honestly don’t think I ever would have been able to move on to adoption had I not first answered that lingering “what if.” And while I don’t have happy feelings regarding the two rounds of IVF I pursued, I do tend to feel like things happen the way they are supposed to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I had come around to adoption sooner, I wouldn’t have my little girl … and I can’t imagine my life turning out any other way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It used video games that included puzzles, word memory, and other mental challenges to help those with MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The popular online games from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lumosity.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lumosity&lt;/a&gt; supposedly help improve memory.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/brain-training-lumosity-does-it-really-work&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no clinical proof&lt;/a&gt; to support those claims, testimonials remain strong that users have quicker recall and better decision-making skills after playing the games.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Users can track their cognitive skills by watching their performance records and comparing them with the general population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some companies have created games specific to MS symptoms. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.multiplesclerosis.com/us/living_with_ms.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MyBrainGames&lt;/a&gt; was designed by Bayer pharmaceutical company. The user may access one of several games or customize it based on their own cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cognifit.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CogniFit&lt;/a&gt; is a healthcare company providing activities for people with MS that offer customization, tracking, and more than 50 brain games. This program is available for computers and also offers tablet and phone apps for a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another game called &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainage.nintendo.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Brain Age&lt;/a&gt; is available for Nintendo DS and Wii consoles. It’s designed to “train a brain in 10 minutes.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Cognitive-Changes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cog-fog&lt;/a&gt; may indicate a possible relapse. By playing games on a regular basis one begins to know their scores and how they usually perform.

<![CDATA[
;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents know that those little bundles of joy bring them plenty of fun and satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it turns out having children has an unanticipated benefit: longer life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2017/01/30/jech-2016-207857&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; out of Sweden, older parents live longer than their neighbors who don’t have children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parenthood is associated with a longer life, particularly in older age, when health and abilities may have declined, according to research published in the Journal of Epidemiology &amp;amp; Community Health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difference is apparent by age 60, the researchers say, and may be as much as two years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The gender of the child or children does not seem to matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, the one-year risk of death for an 80-year-old man with a child was 7.4 percent, compared with 8.3 percent for a man of the same age who didn’t have a child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To investigate whether parenthood might prolong life in older adults, the researchers tracked the lifespan of 704,481 men and 725,290 women from the age of 60 and on. The participants, who all lived in Sweden, had been born between 1911 and 1925. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study concluded at the end of 2014, as the researchers also gathered registry data on the participants’ marital status and the number and sex of any children they had.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why children lengthen your life&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers’ findings come as no surprise to Donna Butts, executive director of Generations United, an organization based in Washington, D.C., that promotes three-generation solutions to personal and societal problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has a solution for those older adults missing out on the benefits of children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you don’t have a child in your life, find one,” she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is no evidence that becoming a surrogate grandparent at age 60 comes with a longevity benefit, but Butts sees it as positive all around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Everyone needs some purpose,” Butts said. “Intergenerational activities are positive on all fronts.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It makes sense,” she said. “Research shows how much good comes from older adults being with young people.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For one thing, the older people reported having a greater social network.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They are more engaged, have more reason to get up in the morning,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways to interact with a child, according to Butts, is through reading. Many literacy programs count on older volunteers reading to children who need to hear stories or improve their reading skills or even share quiet time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you just need to listen to a child,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-02-2017/aarp-bulletin-march-issue-features-50-great-ways-live-longer-exclusive-investigation-medicare-fraud-new-face.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in the March issue of the AARP Bulletin lists 50 ways to live longer, and one of them is to take care of grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Swedish research team also found a similar link between longevity and providing care to grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Men, unmarried get biggest benefits&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newest data suggest you don’t even need to wait for a grandchild or babysit the ones who’ve arrived.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You get the bonus by the mere fact of having procreated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead author on the study is Karin Modig, PhD, who teaches epidemiology at the Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, in Stockholm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research protocol required taking account of influential factors, such as educational attainment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It turned out the risk of death was lower among those who had had at least one child than those who did not have a child — and more so among men than among women. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers said the lower risks were evident among those who were married and unmarried, but seemed to be stronger among those who weren’t married, at least among the men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difference in death risk was 1.2 percent among unmarried men and 0.6 percent among those who were married.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unmarried men might be relying more heavily on their children in the absence of a partner, the researchers suggest. They are also likely to be less educated, whereas the opposite tends to be true of women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research team wondered if the child’s gender would be significant as suggested by a previous study. Perhaps that research had focused on the traditional social benefits of having a daughter. Other types of support, including advocacy and navigating the health system, could be provided by sons as well, they said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team concluded, “Our finding that the association grew stronger when parents became older is further in agreement with research suggesting that childless people face support deficits only toward the end of life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, that two factors (having a child and longevity) coexist does not prove a causal relationship between them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, until further evidence is revealed, speculation about what this finding means continues both inside and outside the scientific community. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
t;&lt;p&gt;Plastic surgery doesn’t seem to be losing in popularity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) reveals that Americans are seeking out cosmetic surgeries and augmentations at a growing rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2016, the ASPS reports plastic surgeons performed 17 million surgical operations and minimally invasive procedures, such as laser hair removal and chemical peels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With more than 290,000 procedures, breast augmentation claimed the top spot for the second year in a row.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The newly released information also reveals the number of cosmetic surgeries that focus on the face is growing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, a new type of plastic surgery popped up on the popular list for the first time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A new focus on fat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the phrase “plastic surgery” may stir up connotations of chemical fillers, silicone breast implants, and injectable artificial ingredients, the ASPS research suggests that patients prefer a more “natural” ingredient in their “plastic” surgery: fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Minimally invasive cosmetic fat injections increased 13 percent in 2016.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, fat grafts in the buttocks also became more popular last year with a 26 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it was breast augmentations that used fat injections that saw the biggest increase, with a 72 percent jump in one year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Plastic surgeons harvest a patient’s unwanted fat from their abdomen using liposuction and then inject it to lift and rejuvenate other areas such as the face, buttock, and even the breast,” said Dr. Debra Johnson, president of ASPS, and a private practice plastic surgeon at The Plastic Surgery Center in Sacramento, Calif., in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/press-releases/new-plastic-surgery-statistics-reveal-focus-on-face-and-fat&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Newer procedures focus on removing fat in less invasive ways, and many of these are more affordable. That may account for the increased popularity in 2016.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fat “freezing” increased 5 percent. Noninvasive skin tightening procedures that target fat pockets and seek to tighten sagging skin increased 5 percent, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fat-targeting injections, which are usually used to reduce pockets of fats in areas like the chin, increased 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While some people may be looking to move fat from one part of their body to another, others are just looking to remove fat altogether.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liposuction took the second spot on the list of most common plastic surgeries in 2016 with 235,237 procedures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A renewed focus on the face&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spots three, four, and five on the list of most popular cosmetic surgical procedures in 2016 have a common theme: changes to the face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nose reshaping and eyelid surgery were both up 2 percent year over year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Face-lifts, which had fallen off the list in recent years, climbed back onto the list at the fifth spot with a 4 percent increase since 2015.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Likewise, many of the top noninvasive or minimally invasive procedures followed the same theme.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number of these procedures topped 15 million in 2016.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections earned the top spot with 7 million procedures. That’s up 4 percent from 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rounding out the list were soft tissue fillers (2.6 million procedures), chemical peels (1.36 million procedures), laser hair removal (1.1 million procedures), and microdermabrasion (775,000 procedures).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What do these minimally invasive procedures have in common?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fast results with little downtime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johnson also thinks it points to people being more proactive about their skin’s appearance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think this represents both a younger demographic trying to take better care of their skin early on, and older patients who are not interested in surgery but want to do something to help them tread water longer,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The role of social media&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The return of the face-lift, as well as the increased emphasis on face procedures in general, points to a suspected common source point: social media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the popularity of selfies and disappearing photo apps like Snapchat reveal anything, it’s that Americans are becoming more obsessed with how they look — and how people respond to their looks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Filters and apps offer airbrushed effects that were once reserved for high-dollar photo editing software, so if a filter can make a person feel proud of their appearance for a short period of time, plastic surgery may offer that boost for a longer time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the reasoning for Johnson, who said in the same ASPS statement, “Patients are captivated by instant improvements to the face. It’s evident in the popularity of apps and filters that change how we shape and shade our faces. While there are more options than ever to rejuvenate the face, a face-lift done by a board-certified plastic surgeon can have a dramatic, longer-lasting result which is why I am not surprised to see face-lifts back in the top five most popular cosmetic surgical procedures.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with Healthline, she added, “I think social media is playing a huge role in increasing awareness of these issues and provides personal experiences with various treatments and surgeries. I think it’s positive that patients can see that others share their same concerns, which can be very validating.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s not quite how Elaine Ducharme, PhD, a licensed clinical psychologist in independent practice in Glastonbury, Conn., sees the social media influence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Social media plays a huge role in impacting self-esteem and drive to alter our bodies. Everyone is so connected to the ‘perfect’ images of celebrities on their phones, iPads, computers, etc. Mixed in with all the friend information on websites such as Facebook, are all kinds of images and ads on how to look more beautiful,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If social media and the pressure to match or meet a self-imposed expectation is the impetus for some of these surgical procedures, Johnson said people aren’t necessarily trying to replicate someone else’s looks for themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is rare that patients come wanting to look like someone else, a celebrity or some beautiful person. Instead they will say, ‘I’d like full cheekbones like Kim Kardashian,’ or ‘I’d like lips like Angelina Jolie.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While others may be quick to blame the Instafamous or the celebrities who use their social media to promote themselves in ways stars never did, celebs may not bear the real blame.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A lot of people have become truly preoccupied with themselves,” Ducharme said. “People judge each other by how they look and then put pressure on themselves to look perfect. People constantly are posting pictures of themselves and watching for comments and compliments. I see teens becoming more preoccupied with their looks and wanting to make changes with Botox.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Labiaplasty grows in popularity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the top procedures focus on the face and the highly visible parts of the body, another less obvious cosmetic procedure is gaining popularity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ASPS started tracking the number of labiaplasty procedures in 2015 and 2016. Doctors performed more than 12,000 of those procedures. That’s a 39 percent increase in one year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This procedure reshapes the labia by lifting skin or filling out areas of the vagina and labia with injectable fillers. Here, too, Ducharme points to the influence of social media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When social media, sexting, and especially pornography began to show female genitalia, women suddenly start comparing, and often feel that if they are different in any way, they must be abnormal,” she said. “There is actually quite a bit of variation in size and shape of labia and the vagina. Social media has just given women one more thing to worry about and feel insecure about.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johnson, however, sees another way social media is influencing and accounting for the increase in vaginal cosmetic changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fashion of removing pubic hair with waxing, laser hair removal, or shaving has made the labia more ‘visible,’ and women thus see themselves more critically. Social media has made labiaplasty less scary to many women,” she said, “Knowing that other women share the same concerns has allowed women to seek consultation with issues they might have otherwise been embarrassed about.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with any type of invasive surgical procedure, cosmetic or otherwise, labiaplasty carries with it risks and possible side effects. These include bleeding, infection, and loss of sensation in the genitalia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Men and plastic surgery&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It might seem, based on outdated stereotypes, that the plastic surgery clientele is almost entirely female, but that’s changing quickly as plastic surgery among men is becoming more common each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 1997 and 2015, the number of plastic surgeries for men increased more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surgery.org/hlcmsresource/ASAPS-Stats2015.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;325 percent&lt;/a&gt;. In 2015, men accounted for more than 1.2 million plastic surgery procedures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The top five surgical procedures were:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;liposuction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;nose surgery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;eyelid surgery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;male breast reduction&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;face-lift&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Men are becoming more open to plastic surgery. The ‘metrosexual’ movement has made caring about your appearance more acceptable to men,” Johnson said. “Men often seek less invasive procedures, including Botox, fillers, laser treatments. They have minimal downtime and no scars.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here again, Ducharme sees the increase in plastic surgery for men in a different light.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Overall, I think social media has had a greater impact on women, since they have traditionally struggled more with body image. On the other hand, I have seen more young men becoming more preoccupied with their bodies and spending inordinate amounts of time at the gym,” she said. “Instead of starving themselves, as do women with eating disorders, they work out in a very unhealthy way. They use nutritional supplements and sometimes drugs to get that perfect body.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Body positivity campaign&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If social media is to blame for the increase in cosmetic procedures, it’s social media that may turn the boat in the other direction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Social media campaigns like Project HEAL’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsnation.in/article/118363-what-makes-beautiful-these-women-asnwer.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#WhatMakesMeBeautiful&lt;/a&gt; encourage people of all shapes and sizes to embrace their bodies and be openly proud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United Kingdom’s Body Gossip uses art and creativity to encourage self-esteem and self-acceptance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign aims to encourage women of all shapes and sizes to get moving to make themselves healthier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s in England where the powerful self-love movement may be gaining some traction. Last year, the number of surgical procedures done there fell &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/13/number-cosmetic-surgery-procedures-uk-fell-2016&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;40 percent&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a near-decade low after hitting their highest numbers in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So many seek plastic surgery to fix imperfections, thinking that somehow their lives will miraculously change for the better. If they don’t really like or accept who they are, the surgery will do nothing to increase their happiness,” Ducharme said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to find a plastic surgeon&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re considering plastic surgery, Johnson reminds you to be careful with your choice of doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Plastic surgery is one of the only specialties in which nonplastic surgeons seek to provide care. It is important for patients to do their homework and assure that the surgeon they choose to perform their cosmetic procedure is truly a ‘plastic surgeon,’” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can start by visiting the ASPS’s website where they maintain a list of board-certified plastic surgeons who are ASPS members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you make an appointment, be sure to ask questions of the doctor and staff. Find out how long they’ve been in practice, what certifications and licenses they have, and what their specialty is, if they have one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to seek second and third opinions to find a doctor that is both licensed and makes you comfortable with your choices and options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You’ve been through it and you can talk about just how it feels.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Moving to heart disease ‘ground zero’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But beyond the doctor’s office, there’s a bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The native New Yorker headed to Memphis in 2003 to join Stern Cardiology Foundation, a 38-doctor group practicing in Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is really the ground zero of heart disease in our country,” Szatkowski said. “To try to help one person at a time is great. But to actually impact a community and a region is so much more. I thought if I could come here and start to inspire people just beyond the patient visit and use all the resources that we have here to actually change the course of the disease, that would something be great to do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That has meant years of outreach: speaking to church groups, civic organizations and news media as well as preaching nutrition, exercise and other heart-healthy themes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Szatkowski has also set up community health screenings, lobbiied politicians to build more parks, and promoted good health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s no set plan,” he said. “You just get involved.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The ‘go-to’ cardiologist&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ron Childers, chief meteorologist at WMC-TV in Memphis, calls Szatkowski the station’s “go-to guy for heart-related issues.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Childers recently chaired the city’s Heart Walk, a fundraiser for the American Heart Association, “I told him I want you to be on our executive leadership team. I knew he has no time, but he still agreed to carve some out. He really cares about the health of the community.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The weatherman also calls Szatkowski his cardiologist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s something about his presence that’s just so inspiring,” said Childers, who adds that the doctor has helped him improve his diet, lower stress and lose weight. “You just don’t want to disappoint him. He wants you to succeed in being healthy and he just has this way of conveying things that makes you want to do it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Szatkowski is equally focused on making his profession better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A few years ago the Stern group dispatched him to its offices across the state line in Mississippi, where he is now director of cardiac services at Baptist Memorial Hospital-DeSoto in Southaven.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He has helped them so much with accreditation, standards and just a total transformation in their cardiac care,” says Debbie Eddlestone, Stern’s chief executive. “I really don’t know how he gets everything done that he does, but he has great time management skills.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hospital recently won several awards in the AHA’s Get With the Guidelines program to improve response to and treatment of heart issues and strokes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Szatkowski is also busy with initiatives to improve quality standards in his physician group and across Baptist Memorial’s 15-hospital system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need to do our part as well as we can, as part of achieving change in the community,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Childers, a Memphis native, jokes that promoting heart health in a region where “we live off fried chicken, fried catfish and barbecue, and most everything starts with bacon grease” is no simple task.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In Arie’s exam room he has a map showing the rates of heart disease, and we’re like the reddest area on the map,” he says. “He’s out there battling that, and we’re lucky to have him.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a challenge, Szatkowski acknowledges, but that also makes it an opportunity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is the leading region for a lot of bad things, like smoking, obesity, diabetes,” he says. “If you can make a difference here, you can have the biggest impact on the death rate in the whole country. It’s a process that takes time, but a lot of people and a lot of organizations here have the same vision, and I think things are getting better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/fateful-days-changed-the-destiny-of-cardiology-doctor/&quot;&gt;original story&lt;/a&gt; was published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/&quot;&gt;American Heart Association News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/032317_msresearch_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath – the fatty substance that protects nerve fibers in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, the nerve fibers can become damaged, which interrupts signaling between the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can lead to movement problems, as well as muscle weakness and numbness or tingling in face, body, and extremities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Who-Gets-MS&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2.3 million people&lt;/a&gt; across the globe are affected by MS, with onset of the condition being most common between the ages of 20 and 50.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At present, there are no laboratory tests that can detect MS, meaning that it can take years to reach a definitive diagnosis. In the meantime, damage to the central nervous system worsens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following an MS diagnosis, there are medications available that can help slow disease progression by suppressing the immune system, but these can have severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new study has revealed the discovery of genetic variants associated with an increased risk of MS. Researchers suggest these variants could fuel the development of new ways to diagnose and treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Co-lead study author Simon Gregory, director of genomics and epigenetics at the Duke Molecular Physiology Institute at Duke University Medical Center in North Carolina, and colleagues reported &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30286-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;their findings&lt;/a&gt; today in the journal Cell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;DNA variants and the immune system&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gregory and his team did a genetic analysis of individuals with and without MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They identified two DNA variants in two genes - DDX39B and IL7R – that increase a person’s risk of MS by threefold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the interaction of these variants leads to an overproduction of a protein called sIL7R. This protein communicates with the immune system, which the researchers believe plays a key role in the development of MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Our study identifies an interaction with a known MS risk gene to unlock a new MS candidate gene, and in doing so, open[s] up a novel mechanism that is associated with the risk of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases,&quot; said Gregory in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, their findings may have important implications for patients, such as more accurate diagnostic techniques for MS and other immune-mediated conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;One could envision how this type of knowledge will someday lead to [diagnosing] multiple sclerosis sooner and, now that we have promising therapies, a doctor could start the appropriate treatment more quickly,” said study co-leader Dr. Mariano Garcia-Blanco, of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Texas Medical Branch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is not out [of] the realm of possibility to imagine a path for screening for other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their findings may also open the door to tests that can screen individuals with a family history of MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This early detection of DNA risk variants may help people to be more aware of MS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Why Taxpayers Sometimes Fund Research for Expensive New Drugs

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/032317_taxpayersdrugs_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A potential deal between the Trump administration and a pharmaceutical company was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-lashed-out-at-sanofi-about-zika-vaccine-contract-2017-3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;harshly criticized&lt;/a&gt; by Sen. Bernie Sanders earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Vermont senator, concerned about potentially inflated drug prices, said President Trump was “on the brink of making a bad deal” that would give French pharmaceutical company Sanofi exclusive patents for a Zika vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The controversy reignited a long-running debate over U.S. taxpayers helping fund pharmaceutical research — only to see pharmaceutical companies jacking up the price once a drug hits the market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While concerns about unaffordable drugs are warranted, there’s far more to the issue than meets the eye, according to experts who spoke to Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sky high prices&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large part of Sanders’ concern over the proposed deal was that Sanofi would overcharge for the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at headlines from the past few years, it’s easy to see why he’s concerned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/new-hepatitis-c-drug-stirs-controversy-041114&quot;&gt;Sovaldi&lt;/a&gt;, a hepatitis C drug developed by Gilead that initially sold for $1,000 per pill, is a prime example of private companies overcharging for a drug that’s research was funded in part by taxpayer dollars, said Will Holley, spokesperson for the Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing (CSRxP).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The R&amp;amp;D for Sovaldi was largely conducted by a small biotech company, later acquired by the current manufacturer, that received the majority of its funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH),” Holley told Healthline in an email. “Gilead purchased this biotech, and then fully recouped the cost of acquiring the company in just one year of sales of the $1,000-per-pill drug.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another high-priced medication that has attracted considerable attention is the &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/cost-of-epipens-forcing-allergy-sufferers-to-syringes&quot;&gt;EpiPen&lt;/a&gt;, an auto-injector that provides epinephrine to people with serious allergies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before costs cooled, the price for the device — one that can mean the difference between life and death — more than quadrupled over a 10-year period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who’s funding what?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When examining this issue, it’s important to make the distinction between basic and applied research in the field of pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Basic research is typically funded through government grants and is conducted by academics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Applied research is usually paid for by private interests and builds off of the initial basic research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“With basic research, there are no clear commercial objectives, and the people who do it are driven to publish their results and make them as widely known as possible,” Stuart Schweitzer, PhD, professor of health policy and management at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, told Healthline. “On the other hand, there is applied research, where organizations say, ‘Hey, there’s a finding out there. I think that we can make a bundle of money if we pursue that. Let’s see if we can turn it into a commercial product.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In effect, it means that while public money can lead to discoveries that are further built on by private companies, most of the money that brings a drug to market is paid for by drug companies rather than taxpayers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While government funding supports basic research, America’s biopharmaceutical companies conduct the critical R&amp;amp;D needed to bring new medicines to patients and bear the associated costs and risks,” Holly Campbell, director of communications for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), told Healthline in an email. “In fact, the biopharmaceutical sectors spend more on R&amp;amp;D than the entire National Institutes of Health operating budget, with all biopharmaceutical companies investing more than $70 billion in R&amp;amp;D.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Campbell also points to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://csdd.tufts.edu/files/uploads/PubPrivPaper2015.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 white paper&lt;/a&gt; from the Tufts University School of Medicine that concluded that 67-97 percent of drug development is conducted by the private sector.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While public dollars rarely fund the direct development of pharmaceuticals, there are exceptions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some come under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which allows the government to fund pharmaceutical firms to develop drugs for conditions that affect a small percentage of the population while limiting the amount of potential profit by private companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schweitzer cites Epogen, a drug for people on dialysis, developed by Amgen, as a success story of the Orphan Drug Act.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When Amgen started its work, the number of patients on kidney dialysis was very small,” he said. “But as soon as it was realized that the number of dialysis patients was growing beyond 200,000 patients, then Amgen had to give up its money to the government. I’ve read stories that there are some exceptions to that, where the money hasn’t been given back, and that’s clearly an oversight, with Congress not enforcing the law as tightly as they should. But the principle is there: If it’s a very small market, even though it’s a commercial product, government will come in because nobody else is going to invest in such a small market.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even when large amounts of money are poured into research and development, there’s no guarantee that the research will actually lead anywhere.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I see the pharmaceutical industry as extraordinarily vulnerable to failure,” said Schweitzer. “It’s a very high-risk business. Something like 10 percent of all drugs that are developed get FDA approval. Merck, a couple of years ago, had a drug for inhaled insulin that cost about $2 billion. It was even approved by the FDA, and nobody bought it. It was a failure. They closed it down and sold their patent rights.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tweaking the system&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of what makes this such a contentious issue is a lack of transparency, creating a system where virtually no public data exists to show the link between prices and development costs, said Holley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Manufacturers should be required to disclose R&amp;amp;D costs for drugs, including how much of the research is funded by the NIH, other academic entities, or another pharmaceutical company later acquired by the current manufacturer,” he said. “A market cannot function when purchasers have limited information and, in the case of prescription drugs, pricing is a black box. Prices for drugs are clearly rising at rates that far exceed inflation and the level of any rebates or discounts offered by manufacturers.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holley says CSRxP would like the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide an annual report that includes the top 50 increases over the past year by both branded and generic drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That report would also have the top 50 drugs by annual spending and how much the government pays in total for these drugs, and historical price increases for common drugs, including Medicare Part B drugs, over the most recent 10-year period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schweitzer said the long FDA approval process can hinder competition, allowing the first company to develop a drug or technology to have a virtual monopoly while other companies go through the approval process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“An example of that is the EpiPen,” Schweitzer says. “How did they get away with raising their price, and nobody came in and underbid them? You’ve got to look at the FDA’s devices section. The drug in the EpiPen, epinephrine, is a generic drug. There’s no secret to it. The secret is in the delivery system itself. How is it that Mylan developed a really good medical device and nobody else could do that? The FDA devices section takes three years to approve a device, and that really hurt a lot of people. So now there is competition in the market for the EpiPen, but it shouldn’t have taken that long.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’d like to see legislation that would have the FDA lighten up on the approval regulations,” said Schweitzer. “So when a drug price has increased by more than, say, 50 percent in a year, the FDA could scare manufacturers away from doing this by ensuring that there’s going to be [a competing product] in the marketplace quite soon. So my answer lies on the supply side, and definitely not price controls, because I don’t believe that we’re going to get as much drug discovery if we take away the motive of making money with a few of our successful drugs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holley agrees that encouraging competition is crucial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The keys to any real solution are increased transparency, removing barriers to competition, especially from generics, and ensuring that prices are correlated with the value that a drug brings to the patients who need them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Should Ibuprofen Be a Prescription Drug?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/heart-health/032217_ibuprofen_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a new study in Denmark linked ibuprofen and another common pain medication to an increased risk of cardiac arrest, one of the study authors called for restrictions on over-the-counter sales of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Concerns about nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are not new.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have linked NSAIDs to increased risk of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i4857&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm454141.htm?source=govdelivery&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;heart attack or stroke&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d3450&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;irregular heart rhythm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Mary Norine Walsh, medical director of heart failure and cardiac transplantation at St. Vincent Heart Center in Indianapolis, and president of the American College of Cardiology, said the new study expands on past research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It elucidates that sudden cardiac arrest is the mechanism of death, at least in [Denmark],” Walsh told Healthline. “And it adds to the data that we already have showing that this class of drug is bad with regard to mortality.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walsh was not involved in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/ehjcvp/article/3/2/100/2739709/Non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drug-use-is&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, which was published Mar. 15 in the European Heart Journal - Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cardiac risks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers reviewed the medical records of 28,947 people who had a cardiac arrest outside of the hospital in Denmark between 2001 and 2010.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also collected data on all prescriptions for NSAIDs filled in the country during that time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 3,000 people who had cardiac arrest — sudden loss of heart function — had taken an NSAID within 30 days before the event.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use of any NSAID raised the risk of cardiac arrest by 31 percent, compared to a previous 30-day period without heart problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/health/drugs/diclofenac/oral-tablet&quot;&gt;Diclofenac&lt;/a&gt; — which is available in the United States only as a prescription — was linked to a 50 percent increased risk of cardiac risk and prescription-strength ibuprofen with a 31 percent greater risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/naproxen/oral-tablet&quot;&gt;Naproxen&lt;/a&gt;, rofecoxib, and &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/celecoxib/oral-capsule&quot;&gt;celecoxib&lt;/a&gt; were not associated with cardiac arrest. The researchers say that this could be because these drugs are seldom prescribed in Denmark and were not represented equally in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results serve as a reminder that NSAIDs are not harmless, even though some are available over-the-counter without a prescription.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“NSAIDs should be used with caution and for a valid indication. They should probably be avoided in patients with cardiovascular disease or many cardiovascular risk factors,” study author Gunnar H. Gislason, professor of cardiology at Copenhagen University Hospital Gentofte in Denmark, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escardio.org/The-ESC/Press-Office/Press-releases/harmless-painkillers-associated-with-increased-risk-of-cardiac-arrest&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Restricting NSAIDs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the cardiac risks, Gislason also suggested that restrictions be placed on the over-the-counter sale of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don't think these drugs should be sold in supermarkets or petrol stations where there is no professional advice on how to use them,” said Gislason. “Over-the-counter NSAIDs should only be available at pharmacies, in limited quantities, and in low doses.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, ibuprofen (such as Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (such as Aleve) are both available over-the-counter, but in lower doses than prescription NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-medicines-nsaids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, heart problems caused by NSAIDs can happen within a few weeks of use, and are more likely to occur with larger doses and long-term use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new study, though, looked only at prescription NSAIDs, so not everyone agrees with the need for restricting the sale of these drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Their data doesn’t address ibuprofen at lower doses because they couldn’t track it,” said Walsh. “So I’m not sure that’s the best recommendation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People also have other non-NSAID options for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Acetaminophen is a very good pain medication for mild pain,” said Walsh. “It is not an anti-inflammatory. It doesn’t have a longer half-life that some of the over-the-counter NSAIDs have. But acetaminophen is a very good pain medication.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Talal Attar, an interventional cardiologist and an assistant professor of clinical internal medicine at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that over-the-counter NSAIDs can be used safely.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“With a young and healthy individual who just sprained an ankle and has to take something for three or four days,” Attar told Healthline, “I think the risk of causing a cardiovascular event — although not zero — is low enough that it’s probably reasonable to have access to those drugs over-the-counter.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Cleveland Clinic recommends that people use over-the-counter NSAIDs for no more than three days for fever and 10 days for pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any longer than that — of if you have a history of, or risk factors for, cardiovascular disease — and you should talk to your doctor first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Attar also suggests that people taking regular prescription medications for high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions be careful when using over-the-counter NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think it’s prudent to speak to your pharmacist or your physician any time you take something over-the-counter — whether it is an NSAID or anything in general — because of the risk of interfering with that medication,” Attar said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with chronic pain — who often use pain medications long-term — can work with their doctor to balance the risks and benefits of NSAIDs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a shared decision between the patient and the doctor,” said Walsh. “If your pain is severe enough and one of these agents has been beneficial for your condition — such as a bad arthritis — it may be something that you want to consider.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mens-health/032217_spermtest_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is currently estimated that worldwide infertility affects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2017-03/aaft-ara032017.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;45 million&lt;/a&gt; couples.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 40 percent of these cases are attributable to the male partner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, approximately &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.resolve.org/about/fast-facts-about-fertility.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1 in 8 &lt;/a&gt;couples cannot conceive and a third of these cases are attributed to male infertility. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Current infertility diagnosing practices are expensive and can only be carried out in a clinic or hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, a team of researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) - both in Boston - have designed a new, inexpensive, and simple tool for diagnosing male infertility. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new device, which hasn't been named yet, is smartphone-operated and can be used from home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using motility and sperm concentration criteria, researchers said the new device analyzes and measures semen quality, ultimately identifying infertility with a degree of 98 percent accuracy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Manoj Kanakasabapathy led the research team that designed and tested the device. The findings were &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aai7863&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Science Translational Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How the device works&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sperm analyzer is made of an optical attachment that connects to both a smartphone and a device onto which users can load a sample of their semen. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The semen sample device is disposable and uses a microchip with a capillary tip. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Users are guided by the app through each stage of the testing process. Additionally, a weight microscale - connected wirelessly to the smartphone - measures the total sperm count. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hadi Shafiee, Ph.D., a principal investigator in the Division of Engineering in Medicine and Renal Division of Medicine at BWH and co-author on the study, explained the team’s motivation:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;We wanted to come up with a solution to make male infertility testing as simple and affordable as home pregnancy tests,” he said. “Men have to provide semen samples in these rooms at a hospital, a situation in which they often experience stress, embarrassment, pessimism, and disappointment. Current clinical tests are lab-based, time-consuming, and subjective. This test is low-cost, quantitative, highly accurate and can analyze a video of an undiluted, unwashed semen sample in less than five seconds.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Accurate, user-friendly&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test the accuracy of the device, Kanakasabapathy and team collected and analyzed 350 clinical semen samples from the MGH Fertility Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnrha.msssi.gob.es/bioetica/pdf/Valores_semen_humano.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;define&lt;/a&gt; normal sperm concentration as higher than 15 million sperm per milliliter, and normal &lt;a href=&quot;https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003627.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;motility&lt;/a&gt; - or the ability of the sperm to move - as more than 40 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on these criteria, researchers said the device detected infertility with 98 percent accuracy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also wanted to test how user-friendly the device is, so they assessed its use by both trained and untrained volunteers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A total of 10 users with no training correctly categorized more than 100 sperm samples as fertile or infertile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Applications of the new device&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers think that the new tool will benefit a variety of people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Men who have undergone a vasectomy can use the home-based device to monitor their sperm several months after surgery. At the moment, vasectomy patients are required to check in regularly with a urologist to make sure the surgery was successful, but the new device could make this practice obsolete. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the new device could serve as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://report.nih.gov/NIHfactsheets/ViewFactSheet.aspx?csid=112&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;point-of-care&lt;/a&gt; testing tool, which could be used not only at the patient’s home but also in the hospital or other locations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors suggest the device could also be used to test fertility in animals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;The ability to bring point-of-care sperm testing to the consumer, or health facilities with limited resources, is a true game changer,&quot; says Dr. John Petrozza, study co-author and director of the MGH Fertility Center. &quot;More than 40 percent of infertile couples have difficulty conceiving due to sperm abnormalities and this development will provide faster and improved access to fertility care. [...] We have really been able to create a product that will benefit a lot of people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new device is currently only a prototype, but as soon as the researchers carry out further tests, they will apply for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/031317_weedopioid_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would you rather have your kid hooked on?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prescription pills or marijuana?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of parents might lean toward those prescription painkillers that they themselves use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But are medications such as &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/oxycodone/oral-tablet#Highlights1&quot;&gt;oxycodone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/hydrocodone/oral-tablet#Highlights1&quot;&gt;hydrocodone&lt;/a&gt; really the lesser of two evils?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both marijuana and prescription opioids have been targeted by the White House.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has made it clear there will be renewed scrutiny of marijuana laws.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In particular, recreational marijuana laws are being targeted for “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/expect-greater-enforcement-of-marijuana-laws-under-trump-spicer-says-2017-02-23&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greater enforcement&lt;/a&gt;,” according to White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Attorney General Jeff Sessions also &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/01/10/jeff-sessions-marijuana-confirmation-hearing/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opposes recreational marijuana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Trump has also promised to do something about the opioid epidemic sweeping across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the Republican &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/11/politics/donald-trump-medicaid-cuts-opioids/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;health plan&lt;/a&gt; he supports reduces funding for a lot of addiction recovery programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the debate over the health effects of both marijuana and prescription painkillers, you might wonder which is actually doing more harm to the United States?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthline decided to take an in-depth look.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Officially, marijuana is more dangerous&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although &lt;a href=&quot;http://norml.org/news/2016/11/10/voters-in-eight-states-approve-marijuana-law-reform-in-unprecedented-election-victories&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;eight states&lt;/a&gt; have passed laws legalizing recreational marijuana use, and 29 states have legalized medical marijuana, federal law still labels marijuana as an illegal substance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DEA classifies marijuana as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Schedule 1 drug&lt;/a&gt;, defined as having no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. Other Schedule 1 drugs include LSD and heroin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Schedule 2 drugs, which include crystal methamphetamine and cocaine, have been accepted as medical treatments in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prescription opioids, which include &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/morphine/oral-tablet#Highlights1&quot;&gt;morphine&lt;/a&gt;, fall into this category of drugs — legal when prescribed by medical personnel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas Strouse, medical director of the Stewart and Lynda Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), thinks the classifications are a bit ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although marijuana can cause health problems if used in excess, he said, there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marijuana-deaths-2014_us_56816417e4b06fa68880a217&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no known cases&lt;/a&gt; of somebody dying from a marijuana overdose. The same cannot be said for opioids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC reports that overdose deaths from opioids have quadrupled since 1999. In 2015, more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/overdose.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt; died from overdoses involving prescription opioids. Those prescription pills now account for nearly half of all U.S. overdoses from opioids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, an average of 1,000 Americans are treated in emergency rooms every day for misusing prescription pills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, the use of prescription medication far outdistances the use of marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, doctors in the United States write &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6501e1.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;259 million&lt;/a&gt; opioid prescriptions a year. The sales of these drugs have more than quadrupled since 1999.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for treatment, Strouse says withdrawal from a marijuana addiction is significantly less severe than withdrawal from an opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strouse said marijuana’s designation as a Schedule 1 drug has more to do with historical and political reasons than any hard data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I believe [the drug classifications] should be based on science,” he told Healthline. “It does not make sense to me that cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Marijuana health effects&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marijuana won’t kill you. Not from an overdose anyway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But is it healthy for you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24625/the-health-effects-of-cannabis-and-cannabinoids-the-current-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; sought to qualify the purported harms as well as benefits of marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Marie McCormick, professor of maternal and child health in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, professor of pediatrics at the Harvard Medical School, and chair of the study, says the widely cited negative side effects of cannabis are hard to substantiate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The classification of cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug makes it very difficult to acquire research-grade samples,” McCormick told Healthline. “There are a lot of questions about the quality of the existing data. Existing studies are variable, even in terms of the concentrations of the cannabis. It’s hard to sort out the data.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the recent report did determine relationships between smoking marijuana and health problems. According to McCormick, “What appears is that smoking does lead to bronchitis, smoking during pregnancy does lead to lower birth rates, and initiating cannabis use at an early age is a risk factor for problematic use.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said there is testing in the workplace, but there’s no data associated with workplace injuries as a consequence of cannabis use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even the widespread concern that marijuana causes poor academic performance among young marijuana users isn’t necessarily correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Early use of cannabis leads to academic failure is the assumption,” McCormick says. “But the questions around cannabis use are asked of students retroactively. We don’t know how the student was doing before the cannabis use.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The literature is mixed on whether marijuana use leads to abuse of other, more harmful drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Usually they’re talking to someone who has another drug problem and asking what they did before,” McCormick says. “What they don’t know about are the people who start cannabis and don’t go any further. There’s no evidence of it being a gateway drug.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report investigated cannabis use and 11 types of health issues, including heart attack and schizophrenia, but could not find strong evidence of a relationship between them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acc.org/about-acc/press-releases/2017/03/09/14/05/marijuana-use-associated-with-increased-risk-of-stroke-heart-failure?w_nav=S&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released over the weekend at the American College of Cardiology said marijuana use is associated with an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strouse said that heavy use of marijuana can lead to psychological disorders in some people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added that marijuana also can do damage to the developing brains of people under the age of 25.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The impact of heavy marijuana use on a developing brain is no small matter,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, McCormick’s report did identify several therapeutic uses for cannabis, including treating chronic pain and treating chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting in cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) touts two recent studies involving marijuana and opioids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://norml.org/news/2017/03/09/medical-marijuana-legalization-associated-with-fewer-opioid-related-hospitalizations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first study&lt;/a&gt;, released this month, reports that statewide legislation that permits medical marijuana use is associated with a reduction of opioid-related hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://norml.org/news/2017/02/16/study-medical-cannabis-patients-reduce-their-use-of-opioids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;second story&lt;/a&gt;, released last month, states that patients with legal access to medicinal marijuana reduce their use of opioids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The data is clear. Cannabis is effective at treating pain, including hard-to-treat pain conditions like neuropathy, and arguably represents a safer alternative to opioids,” Paul Armentano, deputy director of NORML, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the McCormick report recommends a lot more study, including the development of a standard set of questions to ask research participants so data can be consistent across studies, and a review of marijuana’s status as a Schedule 1 drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As a Schedule 2 drug, cannabis would be treated like opioids like morphine and codeine,” McCormick said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The effects of opioids&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As most opioids are legal, there is much more research about their efficacy and potential harms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.teaterhs.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Don Teater&lt;/a&gt;, medical advisor at the National Safety Council from 2013 to 2016, authored the report &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/hlcmsresource/Psycholigical%20and%20Physical%20Side%20Effects%20Teater%20NSC.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Psychological and Physical Side Effects of Pain Medications&lt;/a&gt;, which addresses the national epidemic of opioid abuse, addiction, and overdose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Compared to marijuana, opioids are much riskier, much more dangerous,” Teater told Healthline. “Opioids cause more problems than they’re worth.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opioids prescribed for pain bring fast relief and an accompanying sense of calm. Both effects quickly wear off, however, and a higher dose is necessary to regain the same effects due to increased tolerance to the drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They’re not effective for ongoing improvement of chronic pain,” Teater said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A lot of people are in pain,” Teater added. “And social and emotional factors affect pain and how we deal with it. The pain is made worse by poverty, stress at work, depression, and anxiety. People are looking for a killer medicine to fix it. Behavioral therapy is the best solution — get them exercising, improve mental health, reduce catastrophizing — but everyone is given pills.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teater said quality of life goes down the longer you use prescription painkillers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Opioid receptors in our brains work to keep us motivated, confident about getting things done, and energized to do and finish projects,” he said. “Chronic use of opioids decreases the number of opioid receptors and our own opioids, as the brain quits producing these. We wind up with less motivation, less happiness, and less success. Opioid users have twice the rate of depression as nonusers. The longer you take them, the worse off you’re going to be.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can be a downward spiral.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Life for a user revolves around opioids,” Teater said. “Thus begins a difficult relationship with the prescriber. Every visit focuses on pain and the opioids. Doctors have seven or eight minutes with each patient, a prescription is demanded, and it’s easier to give it to them than to explain why it’s not good for them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teater suggests there are only two appropriate uses for opioids, both short-term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first is acute trauma, as with soldiers with wartime injuries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The sooner they get morphine — and its tremendous calming effect — the less likely they are to develop PTSD,” Teater said. “Opioids keep memories from searing into the consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other time opioids may be called for is at the end of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The calming effect of opioids will help dying patients deal with the pain,” Teater said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Otherwise, he says, over-the-counter medications can be just as helpful as opioids for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One ibuprofen is as effective as two Percocet,” Teater says. “Opioids aren’t even as effective as Tylenol or acetaminophen. No one should be getting an opioid prescription for dental procedures, strains, or sprains. People think opioids are the strongest for pain relief but really it’s the calming effect that they want. It doesn’t have so much to do with the pain.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Drugs and children&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also concerns about opioids in relation to children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two studies published Monday in the journal Pediatrics dealt with the topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/children-ingesting-prescription-pills&quot;&gt;first study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers reported that poison control centers average 32 calls a day connected to young children accidentally ingesting prescription pills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aappublications.org/news/2017/03/20/Opioids032017&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;second study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers said most teens abusing prescription opioids had been given them at a younger age for medical reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marijuana isn’t great for young children either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/marijuana-popularity-increases-childrens-exposure-rises&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last year reported that accidental exposures of children to marijuana were rising in Colorado after that state legalized medicinal marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said the exposures were mainly due to parents leaving marijuana in places where young children could find it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of those exposures involved food laced with cannabis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The children admitted to the hospital suffered from vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, and respiratory problems. There were a few cases of seizures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, no deaths were reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: Officials at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) did not respond to Healthline’s requests for an interview for this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That’s when Congress approved a law forbidding federal funds from being used on firearms research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/policy-gun-violence-research-ban-lifted-after-newtown-shooting-012114#2&quot;&gt;ban was lifted&lt;/a&gt; in January 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Firearm injuries are tied to one of the most controversial political issues in the country, so it is important for all sides to have access to fact-based research,” Spitzer said. “Cost information can be especially helpful when making health policy decisions.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who’s getting shot&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that the gunshot victims were overwhelmingly male.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was also a connection between their insurance status and how they were injured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The shootings of younger individuals with those with lower incomes insured by Medicaid comprised two-thirds of the firearm injuries. These people were most often the victims of an assault.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Older people with Medicare coverage were more likely to have self-inflicted gunshot wounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers uncovered that 40 percent of the total healthcare costs related to gun injuries is paid for by the government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a very high financial burden,” Spitzer said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She also noted that these kinds of cases can be ongoing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a cost if you're readmitted. There's long-term rehab, and a lot of these patients end up needing long-term healthcare,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spitzer’s team next plans to analyze data on the costs of hospital readmissions in gun-related cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
t;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever worked 24 hours straight?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some young, aspiring doctors will soon be doing just that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First-year medical residents will be allowed to work 24-hour shifts later this year, when a cap previously limiting shifts to 16 hours is lifted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) issued a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acgme.org/Portals/0/PDFs/Nasca-Community/Section-VI-Memo-3-10-17.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; saying the revisions would “return first-year residents to the same schedule as other residents and fellows” and will be implemented during the 2017-2018 academic year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number of clinical and educational hours for residents will remain the same with a maximum of 80 hours of work per week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But under the new revisions first-year doctors will now be permitted to work a 24-hour shift, plus an additional four hours to help facilitate transitions between doctors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why the long hours?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ACGME argues that raising the cap on hours will ensure a “seamless continuity of care.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the move has sparked criticism. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The ACGME’s adoption of this dangerous proposal displays a reckless disregard for the lives and health of thousands of medical residents and their patients nationwide,” Dr. Michael Carome, director of the Public Citizen’s Health Research Group, said in a&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.citizen.org/pressroom/pressroomredirect.cfm?ID=10202&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Fourth-year medical students across the country are now bracing themselves for inhuman shifts that will require them, just after graduating from medical school, to make life-or-death medical decisions and to drive home while sleep deprived for 28 hours or longer.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, the ACGME capped the number of hours first-year residents could work in one shift at 16 hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, the ACGME says the hypothesized benefits of limiting first-year hours were not realized and “the disruption of team-based care and supervisory systems, has had a significant negative impact on the professional education of the first-year resident, and effectiveness of care delivery of the team as a whole.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Dr. Kelly Thibert, president of the American Medical Student Association, says that shorter shifts don’t necessarily equate to diminished continuity of care for patients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of the recurring critiques of resident work-hour restrictions is that shorter shift lengths would lead to an increase in number of handoffs and thus would lead to decreased continuity of care. This concern is valid, but the perception that shorter shifts must come at the expense of patient safety due to the increased number of handoffs is just that, a perception,” she told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is not the number of transitions but rather the quality of transitions that is critical to ensuring patient safety. Even at the end of 28-hour shifts, transitions of care still occur and these come at a time when residents are more likely to leave out information they deem ‘unimportant’ as they have reached and surpassed the point of exhaustion.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Doctors facing burnout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Eve Kellner, president of the Committee of Interns and Residents (CIR), says an 80-hour work week puts enormous pressure on residents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Doctors are human and humans require time to attend to the needs of life,” she told Healthline. “When you’re working an 80-hour week, you don't see your children or significant other who, in moments of despair, might be the only thing that has been staving off feeling isolated or developing depression. Not to mention how impossible it is to go to the DMV, mail a package, get laundry done, make healthy food choices, and other simple things that a human intern needs to tend to.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kellner says physician burnout has reached epidemic levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a survey of CIR members, 62 percent felt so burned out that it had affected their work and 28 percent had fallen asleep when driving after work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the high risk of burnout, Thibert says young doctors feel obligated to keep up with the demanding schedule. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You would be hard pressed to find an intern or resident physician who would not work these long hours for fear of retaliation. It is engrained in the profession that this is how medicine operates and should therefore continue to operate,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An exception, not the rule&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acgme.org/Portals/0/PDFs/Nasca-Community/Section-VI-Memo-3-10-17.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Thomas Nasca, chief executive officer of the ACGME, notes that the subject of work hours is an emotional topic both within the medical community and among the general public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he emphasizes that not all residents will regularly be expected to work a 24-hour shift. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is important to note that 24 hours is a ceiling, not a floor. Residents in many specialties may never experience a 24-hour clinical work period. Individual specialties have the flexibility to modify these requirements to make them more restrictive as appropriate, and in fact, some already do,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kellner says although in the past there has been a culture that encouraged doctors to work long hours, this doesn’t necessarily need to be the expectation going forward. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The pressure to work excessive hours is part of the history and culture of medicine, but it is slowly changing. Residents are called residents because they used to literally live in the hospital. The norms were set by a physician workforce that was largely middle and upper class men, but residency is becoming much more diverse and inclusive. We need to realize that our own health shouldn’t suffer while we are caring for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Genetic Score May Help Predict Alzheimer’s</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/aging/032117_alzheimersgenes_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s estimated that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alz.org/facts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;5.5 million&lt;/a&gt; U.S. adults are now living with Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The large majority of these people (5.3 million) are over the age of 65. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The costs of caring for people with Alzheimer’s are also significant. Almost $260 billion in healthcare costs are predicted for this year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The medical &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alz.org/research/funding/alzheimers_our_commitment.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; community is working to find ways of diagnosing Alzheimer’s as early as possible. In the near future, physicians hope to be able to treat the disease before irreversible damage occurs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team of international researchers, led by scientists at University of California-San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and University of California-San Francisco (UCSF), are moving closer to this goal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team designed a genetic score that they say predicts the risk of dementia among aging individuals with a high degree of accuracy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings were &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002258&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal PLOS Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Analyzing genetic variations&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed the genotype of more than 70,000 patients with Alzheimer’s enrolled in several studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They collected genetic data from healthy individuals in a control group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are commonly associated with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/snp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SNPs&lt;/a&gt; are the most widespread type of genetic variation in our DNA. These variations are sometimes associated with certain illnesses, so they serve as biomarkers that help scientists to identify the disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this study, the scientists examined Alzheimer’s-related SNPs as well as the status of the APOE gene. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/APOE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;APOE gene&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for encoding apolipoprotein E - a protein that ultimately forms lipoproteins, which enclose and carry cholesterol and other fats through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People that have the E4 variation of the APOE gene are known to be more likely to develop age-induced Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Based on this information and the data collected, the researchers used a polygenic score to determine the risk of developing age-related Alzheimer’s. They then tested it on two separate samples of people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A polygenic hazard score (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3605113/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PHS&lt;/a&gt;) is the weighted sum of gene variation used to predict individual genetic traits and assess disease risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study co-first author Rahul S. Desikan, Ph.D., clinical instructor in the UCSF Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, explained the study procedure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We combined genetic data from large, independent cohorts of patients with AD with epidemiological estimates to create the scoring, then replicated our findings on an independent sample and validated them with known biomarkers of Alzheimer’s pathology,” Desikan said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Accurate genetic tool&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people scoring in the top 25 percent of the PHS developed Alzheimer’s at a much younger age and had the highest incidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those with a high PHS score developed Alzheimer’s 10 to 15 years earlier than those with a low PHS. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using the PHS score, the scientists were also able to identify the people who ultimately developed Alzheimer’s, despite the fact that they were cognitively healthy at the start of the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tool enabled researchers to identify the age of Alzheimer’s (AD) onset even among participants who did not have the APOE E4 gene variation. The calculated score correlated strongly with neuropathology and AD-specific neurodegeneration. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For any given individual, for a given age and genetic information, we can calculate your ‘personalized’ annualized risk for developing AD. That is, if you do not already have dementia, what is your yearly risk for AD onset, based on your age and genetic information. We think these measures of polygenetic risk, of involving multiple genes, will be very informative for early AD diagnosis, both in determining prognosis and as an enrichment strategy in clinical trials,” said Deskian.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study’s senior author also commented on the significance of the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“From a clinical perspective, the polygenic hazard score provides a novel way not just to assess an individual’s lifetime risk of developing AD, but also to predict the age of disease onset,” said Anders Dale, Ph.D., who is also a professor in neurosciences, radiology, psychiatry, and cognitive science at the University of California-San Diego School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Equally important, continuous polygenic testing of AD genetic risk can better inform prevention and therapeutic trials and be useful in determining which individuals are most likely to respond to therapy,” Dale added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors also point out some of the study’s limitations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, the genetic data they used mainly belonged to people of European descent, so the study offers no evidence as to how PHS works for people of other ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

How Much Should a Workplace Accommodate Breastfeeding Employees?
</title>

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/032017_breastfeedwork_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pumping in the bathroom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In some workplaces, that’s the only option for breastfeeding moms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In others, even that’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most health experts recommend breastfeeding for the first year when possible and desirable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lack of support in the workplace may be one reason that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/pdf/2016breastfeedingreportcard.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;breastfeeding rates&lt;/a&gt; in the United States drop after six months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Katy Tang, a San Francisco supervisor, recently introduced legislation that could potentially change that, at least in her city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ordinance would require private and public workplaces to provide a lactation space with a seat, a surface, an electrical outlet, and access to a sink. All new construction would have to include a lactation space. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/SF-may-require-breastfeeding-friendly-workplaces-10981678.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/a&gt; notes that Tang is open to hardship exemptions for some small businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dol.gov/whd/nursingmothers/Sec7rFLSA_btnm.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;federal law&lt;/a&gt; currently requires employers to allow break time to express milk, along with a private place to do so. It can’t be a bathroom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This law applies only to companies with more than 50 employees, and there are hardship exemptions. There are no federal rules for electrical outlets or sinks, although some states have more requirements than the federal law. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With repeal of the ACA on the table, those federal requirements may disappear, leaving the matter to states or individual businesses. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Some concerns&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antonia Townsend is the founder of TheEnclosed.com, which has four employees in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Townsend is also expecting her first child in a few months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I plan to breastfeed and pump in the office as needed throughout my first few months. While we will not have a ‘lactation space,’ we are taking a conference room and making it more private with curtains,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Townsend acknowledged her privileged situation as the boss. But she’d do the same for any of her employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, she believes all employers should do everything possible to help mothers breastfeed or pump at work. She added that it’s a crucial part of keeping these women in the workforce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even so, she doesn’t embrace the idea of strict legal requirements for lactation spaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For her business, it would be “completely untenable,” she said. “Especially if the requirement didn’t specify the size of the business and other parameters.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TheEnclosed.com rents space in an office building shared by other businesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Townsend’s lactation space will have access to electricity but no sink. This setup, she said, is the only way it’s feasible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It [the sink] would require complete re-plumbing of rented space. Landlords wouldn’t pay. We’d have to move or shut down the business if it was really a requirement,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Townsend is part of Dogpatch Business Association, a group of local businesses including bars, restaurants, accounting services, and others. She said it likely wouldn’t be different for any of them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It would be a straight-up deal breaker for the majority of small businesses, especially with rents in San Francisco,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m hyperaware because San Francisco is legislation-happy. As a result, small businesses are getting squeezed out of the city. We don’t want to squeeze women of childbearing age out of the workforce as less desirable hires,” she continued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of her concerns are informed by the past, she explained. She once worked for a company where, though it certainly wasn’t a written policy, the culture was not friendly toward hiring women of childbearing age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That is the implication of this type of legislation,” said Townsend. “It puts this perceived burden of ever hiring women of childbearing age which, to me, is a far more horrible concern. Don’t get me wrong, you have to be able to breastfeed or pump. But it’s the other side of this, that’s what we risk, and it’s a really frightening prospect. This sort of legislation could have a subtle, but material impact on hiring practices.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to business, size might matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Townsend suggested that any legislation on lactation spaces should at least differentiate between small, medium, and large businesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there’s more to it than size.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A large office with extra space might be able to handle it. But a large restaurant with a hundred employees on a high-trafficked street — think of the rent on that. Creating a lactation space would be totally prohibitive. They’d have to leave the area. You have to understand the physical setup of each business,” said Townsend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s why legislation like this is problematic. It comes down to a case-by-case basis.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A tale of two businesses&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Erica Perng, director of communications at Lumos Labs, Inc. (Lumosity) reports a positive breastfeeding-work relationship. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In addition to offering 12 weeks of paid leave, when I returned to work, I had access to a serene Mother's Room equipped with a comfortable chair, pillows, ottoman, hospital grade pump, drawers to store my pump parts, a refrigerator, sink, and extras like a bottle brush, dish soap specifically for removing breast milk residue, dish rack specifically for pump parts, nursing tea, parenting books, and a bulletin board for putting up baby photos.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a good way to retain valuable employees. It’s a setup that enabled Perng to breastfeed her son beyond his first birthday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Perng points out, businesses in Silicon Valley tend to be supportive of working parents. But it’s probably more than many companies around the country could manage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mark Aselstine, founder of Uncorked Ventures, does business just outside of San Francisco. He has a small, part-time staff, and breastfeeding hasn’t been an issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He thinks requiring new construction to include lactation space is a great concept. But he shares Townsend’s concerns about business size and older, established buildings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The ability of a business when they hire their first employee is dramatically different than say Google, Facebook, or Apple,” he said. “Where I get concerned as a small business owner is that if size isn't taken into account, do I need to create this space, before I can even hire an employee?” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aselstine told Healthline that his wife had to deal with less-than-ideal setups at work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some of the time, it was the best that an employer or site could do. Other times, it seemed they simply didn't care all that much. It always seems better to me to allow people to make the best accommodation that they can, given the space and monetary requirements at play. But I know that also leads to some percentage of people thinking that means there aren't any real requirements,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It seems like those two are competing concepts, which is why our local ordinance for new construction is pretty important. If I moved into my own space, it would be great to have ordinances like this taken care of already,” said Aselstine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lactation spaces don’t solve everything&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blogger Mary Kathryn Tiller of Texas likes the ordinance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She told Healthline it would go a long way to improving women’s experiences of pumping in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not that it would solve every problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiller has had access to a private room in the workplace. She called it a partial win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When her first child was born, she used the company conference room and brought her laptop in so she could continue working while pumping. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only thing between her and her co-workers was an “in use” sign on the door. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the time her second child came along, she had a new job and a private nursing room. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The downside was that her job involved a desktop computer. And she was paid by the hour. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I needed the mobility, like a laptop, to move my workspace into the private room,” said Tiller. “Otherwise, I would have to clock out and lose pay. Unless the company's culture is supportive of breastfeeding mothers and will not punish them, either socially or financially, it doesn't solve all the problems.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tiller credits both employers with being family friendly and supportive of her desire to breastfeed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, neither was adequately equipped with the tools to help me blend work and breastfeeding in a way that didn’t detract from my work day. I think you need both, the moral support and the equipment to be successful as a breastfeeding mom in the workplace,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eventually, she and her husband decided things would work out better if she stopped working outside the home. It wasn’t the only reason, but not having to deal with pumping on the job was definitely a factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My advice to mothers who cannot afford to leave their job is pump if you can. It's hard work and terribly inconvenient. But if it's what you desire to do for your child, it's worth it and it's just for a season. If pumping wears you out, or is just not feasible in your job, formula provides a fantastic alternative for your babies. You're working hard to provide for your kiddos, financially and nutritionally, whether you use breast milk or formula,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
ike millions of Americans, Rachel Phalen is grateful for the Medicaid expansion that accompanied the passage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phelan&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a substitute teacher from Kentucky, has an 11-year-old son, Vance, who suffered a stroke in utero that caused him to have seizures for the first year of his life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, he has autism, tic disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of Vance’s needs, Phelan said, are insured only because of a Medicaid-covered waiver in her state. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Considering all the obstacles he faces, Vance has significantly improved in all areas of his life,” she told Healthline. “He requires constant speech and behavior therapy. He is growing into a functional person.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if Medicaid funding is cut, Vance would likely lose many of his much-needed services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It will set him back so far,” Phelan said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Medicaid cuts on horizon&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If House Republican leaders and President Trump have their way, nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonynitti/2017/03/13/gop-health-care-bill-will-result-in-a-huge-tax-cut-for-the-rich-24-million-without-insurance/#6ba2c1eb6a2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$880 billion&lt;/a&gt; in Medicaid funds will be cut over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the same period of time, wealthy Americans would receive a tax cut of just about the same amount.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the House GOP’s plan, Medicaid expansion will be killed, and payments to the states will be capped and paid out by block grants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of the feds paying a set percentage of the states’ Medicaid needs, they would only pay a fixed amount per beneficiary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This cap does not account for the almost inevitable increases in healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the GOP plan, recipients will be cut off if they lose eligibility for two or more months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics say it is just a way to take more Americans in need off the program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The majority of the recipients of the Medicaid expansion are typically on the program temporarily, or come in and out of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, the proposed changes have struck fear into the hearts of millions of Americans, including families with low incomes, seniors, those with intellectual and developmental disabilities, pregnant women, people dealing substance abuse, and children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Obamacare to become Trumpcare?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Obamacare was passed, Medicaid was expanded to include all Americans under age 65 who earn up to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/federal-poverty-level-eligibility-medicare-medicaid-benefits.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;138 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the federal poverty level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then, Kentucky and 30 other states and the District of Columbia have chosen to participate in the expansion, with 19 states abstaining.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 11 million adults have enrolled since the expansion through March 2016, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/medicaid-expansion-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a review&lt;/a&gt; by the Kaiser Family Foundation of data from the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond those 11 million, Medicaid, which has been available since the 1960s, covers an additional 57 million Americans, almost six times as many as those enrolled in the Obamacare marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would not cut Medicaid. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the House bill will lead to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/us/politics/affordable-care-act-health-congressional-budget-office.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;14 million&lt;/a&gt; fewer individuals being covered by Medicaid by 2026, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Debate in Ohio&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Ohio alone, some 3 million residents with low incomes or disabilities are now receiving coverage because of the Medicaid expansion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at the Center for Community Solutions, a nonpartisan group based in Cleveland, said the plan could cost Ohio more than $25 billion by 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The center concluded that the resulting payments wouldn't be enough in Ohio to keep covering the state’s recipients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Columbus Dispatch reported that Ohio's proposed Medicaid budget for next year is projected at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dispatch.com/news/20170313/ohio-could-lose-26-billion-under-trumpcare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$28 billion&lt;/a&gt;, including federal funding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who enacted the Medicaid expansion in his state under Obamacare in 2013, opposes his fellow Republicans’ plan to cut Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said Republicans need to reconsider their plan and come to a compromise with Democrats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If all you focus on in life is what's in it for me, you're a loser. You are a big time loser,” Kasich said on “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/john-kasich-trump-very-open-compromise-health-care-n732386&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meet the Press&lt;/a&gt;” this month. “And this country better be careful we're not losing the soul of our country because we play politics and we forget people who are in need.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kasich also took issue with an interview Vice President Mike Pence did on an Ohio television station in which Pence said the new legislation would give Ohio the “resources and flexibility that they need to be able to meet those needs going forward.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Said Kasich, “No, he's not right. Look, the bill needs [to be] fixed. The current system doesn't work. That's why it's possible to get Democrats involved … Don't kill Medicaid expansion, and you've got to fix the exchange, but you have to have the ability to subsidize people at lower income levels.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Disdain for the poor&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plans that Republicans and Trump have for Medicaid are actually not conservative enough for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/health-reform-implementation/324479-freedom-caucus-still-opposes-gop-health-plan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freedom Caucus&lt;/a&gt;, an ultraconservative group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, a growing number of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/14/politics/moderate-republicans-health-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;moderate GOP governors and Congress members&lt;/a&gt; say the plan reflects an uncaring side of the GOP toward people with low or no incomes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An example of this uncaring contingent is Kansas Republican Congressman Roger Marshall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Just like Jesus said, ‘The poor will always be with us.’ There is a group of people that just don’t want healthcare and aren’t going to take care of themselves. I think just morally, spiritually, socially, [some people] just don’t want healthcare,” he told &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/what-happens-if-gop-health-plan-approved&quot;&gt;New York magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seema Verma, the woman Trump tapped as the new administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), appears to share the same opinion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just hours after she was sworn in last week, Verma reportedly sent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/on-first-day-in-office-new-medicaid-chief-urges-states-to-charge-premiums-prod-recipients-to-get-jobs/2017/03/15/8d36c480-0928-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a letter&lt;/a&gt; to the nation’s governors, urging states to alter Medicaid by imposing insurance premiums, charging recipients for part of emergency room bills, and prodding them to get jobs, according to multiple news reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The letter also called the Medicaid expansion a “clear departure from the core, historical mission of the program.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics of Verma, who was approved virtually down party lines in the Senate, say that the Medicaid expansion is actually right in line with what Medicaid has always been about: assisting America’s less fortunate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verma had already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/15/architect-indianas-medicaid-plan-faces-confirmation-hearing/97965042/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;riled critics&lt;/a&gt; when she worked for Pence when he was governor of Indiana. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Verma’s Medicaid model in Indiana threw a person out of the program for missing two payments — no matter what their life circumstances at the time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘Remarkable level of cruelty’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In December, Dr. Robert Zarr, president of Physicians for a National Health Program, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnhp.org/news/2016/december/doctors-group-calls-on-trump-to-rescind-nominations-of-price-verma-to-key-health-&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Verma’s actions in Indiana “signal that she will inflict cruel and unusual punishment on America's most vulnerable citizens.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) told the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/us/politics/seema-verma-medicaid-medicare-administrator.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that Verma made millions of dollars in consulting fees by kicking poor, working people off of Medicaid for failure to pay monthly contributions similar to premiums.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Carome, director of the health research group at Public Citizen, the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization, told Healthline, “The House Republicans’ plan to cut nearly a trillion dollars from the Medicaid budget over the next 10 years, while simultaneously giving a huge tax break to wealthy individuals and corporations, demonstrates a remarkable level of cruelty and callousness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carome, whose organization spearheaded the Clean Budget Coalition, an alliance of hundreds of public interest groups that together are calling on Congress and the White House to pass a clean budget with no ideological riders, said that the Republican health plan, if enacted, “would deprive millions of our country’s poorest and most vulnerable people of the healthcare they deserve, resulting in preventable suffering and death.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Seniors affected, too&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group that perhaps stands to lose the most if these controversial plans for Medicaid are approved is seniors, who voted for Trump by a wide margin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without Medicaid, millions of seniors and their families may simply not be able to pay for things like long-term care, nursing home services, and other services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nancy LeaMond, executive vice president of The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the nation’s largest group for seniors with more than 37 million members, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2017/aarp-opposes-healthcare-bill.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; last week, that the Medicaid cuts would put the health and safety of 17 million Americans, including seniors as well as children and adults with disabilities, “in jeopardy” by eliminating services that allow individuals to live independently in their homes and communities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This harmful legislation would make healthcare less secure and less affordable,” LeaMond said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump’s press secretary, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/08/press-briefing-press-secretary-sean-spicer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sean Spicer&lt;/a&gt;, dismissed the AARP’s concerns about the bill, suggesting that AARP is a special interest group.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, said on Thursday that &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/03/white-house-says-cutting-meals-on-wheels-is-compassionate.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deep cuts&lt;/a&gt; in Trump’s proposed budget to multiple programs for seniors and the poor is “one of the most compassionate things we can do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;San Diego seniors fearful&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beverly G., who’s in her 80s and still lives in her own home in San Diego, said Medi-Cal, which is California’s version of Medicaid, “means absolutely everything. End of story. There is no other answer. If I didn’t have it, I’d be really, deeply struggling.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beverly is a member of ElderHelp, a community-based nonprofit organization in San Diego that provides personalized services and information that helps seniors remain independent and live with dignity in their own homes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Members of ElderHelp are worried and uncertain about what will happen to their Medicaid benefits, say the leadership at the organization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our response to the GOP plan aligns closely with that of the National Council on Aging (NCOA), AARP, and other national leaders in the aging sector,” Anya Delacruz, associate executive director of ElderHelp, told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In the context of Medicaid, we are particularly concerned that proposed per capita caps will shift the burden of skyrocketing healthcare costs to the states,” she said. “We believe that resultant/imminent cuts will lead to a significant reduction in necessary services.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Delacruz added that more than one-third of ElderHelp members receive assistance through Medi-Cal. Many, she explained, are already struggling to meet their most basic needs including housing, transportation, food, and rising healthcare costs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The drug crisis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a time when America is dealing with a nationwide opioid drug abuse epidemic, the Republican healthcare plan would also eliminate the Obamacare requirement that Medicaid cover mental health and addiction services in states that expanded it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his speech last month before Congress, President Trump addressed the drug crisis and vowed, “We will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the rollback of Medicaid expansion would deeply affect many states where the opioid addiction crisis is the most severe, including Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you are drug addicted, if you are mentally ill, you have to consistently see the doctor,” Kasich said in his “Meet the Press” interview. “From what I see in this House bill, the resources are not there.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Joshua Sharfstein, associate dean at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/03/09/gop-health-care-bill-would-drop-mental-health-coverage-mandate-covering-1-3-million-americans/?utm_term=.14801884&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; that the Republicans healthcare plans represent “a major retreat from the effort to save lives in the opiate epidemic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nearly 1.3 million Americans receive treatment for mental health and substance abuse disorders under the Medicaid expansion, healthcare economists Richard G. Frank of the Harvard Medical School, and Sherry Glied of New York University, recently told the Post.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Children affected, too&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medicaid cuts in states like Virginia, where the budget is already tight, could mean far fewer children are covered, according to a Public News Service (PNS) report last week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vox reported that Virginia Medicaid covers about half a million children from low-income households. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Margaret Nimmo Holland, executive director at Voices for Virginia's Children, said there’s been bipartisan consensus in Virginia that children's health is worth the investment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said 19 out of 20 children in Virginia now have healthcare coverage, and the care delivered through Medicaid was designed by doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She told Vox that shifting costs from the feds to an already strained Virginia budget would mean fewer children covered, less generous benefits, or lower payments to providers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is very concerning that 50 years of progress in children's health could be undone so quickly,” Holland said. “The benefits are actually designed by pediatricians, so it means that lawmakers are not deciding what services kids need, pediatricians are. And so any time that you start cutting the benefits, you're really jeopardizing the health of children.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Recipients meet with congressman&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Mar. 3, Rachel Phelan and her son’s speech therapist, Leslie McColgin, along with several others with children who receive support from Medicaid, visited the office of Kentucky Rep. James Comer, the Congressman in their district.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phelan said that while the meeting with Comer’s staff, which Comer himself did not attend, went well, their questions weren’t really answered. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I do not believe [Comer] will care or listen,” Phelan said. “I hope that somewhere out there these politicians can grow a heart, and realize the way they vote and run our country affects everyone. If you cannot stand up for our vulnerable, then what kind of person are you?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the federal government or states stop funding these programs, Phelan wonders what will happen to children with disabilities, like her son, nationwide who are in need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Kids with disabilities become adults with disabilities,” she said. “How will we help this vulnerable group? We can’t simply institutionalize them. They are citizens and they have rights.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phelan said that applying block grants to Medicaid will create a national “disaster” for Medicaid recipients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s not enough funding now for our Medicaid system,” she said. “If we ration the funding, we will have to resort to further rationing care. Those who are disabled do not have other options for care. The will suffer greatly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s note: Comer’s press office declined to respond to several requests for comment for this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Poison Centers Inundated with Calls About Children Ingesting Prescription Pills

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/032017_childopioids_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every 45 minutes, on average, a call is made to a poison control center in the United States about a child being exposed to prescription opioids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s 32 calls every day from January 2000 through December 2015, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2017/03/16/peds.2016-3382&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the Center for Injury Research and Policy, and the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research was published today in the journal Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers said the data show the current opioid crisis is affecting not just adult Americans but their children, through both accidental and intentional misuse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We knew we would find something, but the numbers smacked me across the face,” Dr. Marcel Casavant, one of the study’s authors, told Healthline. “This is really a lot of kids.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What the numbers show&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 188,000 calls came into U.S. poison control centers regarding pediatric exposure to opioids during the time period studied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 60 percent of those were regarding children younger than age 5.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second most common age group affected was teenagers. More than two-thirds of those incidents were intentional. That represented a 50 percent increase in suspected teenage opioid-related suicides over the 16 years covered by the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 2009, exposures have actually decreased, but researchers said that news comes with two caveats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Incidents involving buprenorphine, a prescription drug used to help people addicted to opioids, have continued to climb. The study notes nearly half of those incidents have been serious enough to warrant admitting the patient to a healthcare facility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s possible the overall decrease could be partly due to people turning to nonprescription opioids, exposure to which wasn’t included in this study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So maybe it means good news, maybe it means legal and pharmaceutical and education actions are finally paying off and we’re getting control of this epidemic. But maybe it means people have just been driven to street drugs, like heroin,” said Casavant, who is medical director of the Central Ohio Poison Center and chief toxicologist at Nationwide Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The heroin problem&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Deaths from heroin overdoses have increased sharply since 2010.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, that increase doesn’t necessarily mean children have an increased risk of exposure to drugs like heroin in the home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike a bottle of pills that might be lying on the bathroom counter, “people tend to be a lot more careful with heroin,” Casavant notes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Nicole Villapiano, a University of Michigan pediatrician who was not involved with the study, told Healthline the findings are consistent with what she sees in her own practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you're working in the ER, it feels like a nearly daily occurrence” to see children or teenagers exposed to opioids, said Villapiano, who has conducted research on increasing numbers of babies born with drug withdrawal symptoms from opioids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She called the new findings “yet another unintended consequence of prescription opioids.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to reduce the problem&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not all of the child exposure to opioids can be avoided, but using different packaging or administering the drugs differently could lower the numbers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the case of exposure to buprenorphine, Villapiano thinks those incidents could be cut by administering the drug via an implantable rod — rather than the more common pills or dissolvable strip — more frequently, removing the possibility of misuse by another individual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More broadly, adult Americans are allowed by law to request prescriptions in nonchild-resistant containers, letting the elderly or those with disabilities avoid hard-to-open bottles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Casavant said that’s fine if you’re careful with those bottles, but if there are children in the house or you, say, carry them in your purse to a house with kids, it’s risky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The story we hear all the time is, ‘I just turned around for a second, I turned back, and my kid ate 10 or 15 pills,’” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Child-resistant containers are no guarantee, though, particularly in terms of a teenager who intends to deliberately ingest the pills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But both accidental and intentional exposures might be reduced through the use of different packaging, such as blister packs that require each pill to be punched out individually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Casavant says that around half the teenagers he sees in the ER and his clinic who have attempted suicide regret it immediately after the attempt, leading them to call the poison control hotline or run to tell their parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Punching out individual pills won’t prevent suicide by overdose, but it could give teenagers more time to change their minds before it’s too late.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted that situations like that are where calls to a poison control center are critical. The study found most of the cases called into the centers were able to be handled at home with the guidance of the call center staff.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Poison Control &lt;a href=&quot;1-800-222-1222&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hotline&lt;/a&gt; in the United States is 1-800-222-1222. There are poison control specialists available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mens-health/031917_vasectomies_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting a vasectomy isn’t something men usually think to do with some of their buddies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that’s what three Southern California fathers did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paul Diaz, Basilio Santangelo, and John Lambrechts went to the same doctor on the same day to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://ucla.multimedia-newsroom.com/index.php/2017/03/06/starting-conversations-ending-stigmas-about-vasectomies/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;back-to-back-to-back vasectomies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The men have two children each. They said part of the reason for their decision was to take responsibility for their family planning after their wives had done the giving birth part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I didn't want my wife to have to go back on birth control because I know there's a lot of issues with it. So then I thought I would take one for the team and I decided I would do it,” Lambrechts told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My wife, Sabrina, already went through a lot giving birth,” added Santangelo, “and so I figured it's an easier option for me to do this.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trio also did the appointments together as a way to spotlight the low percentage of men in the United States who get vasectomies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It's not something to be ashamed of, and on the contrary, it's you being responsible,” Diaz told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not part of U.S. culture&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/family/trendsContraceptiveUse2015Report.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 report&lt;/a&gt; by the United Nations showed that 1 in 10 men in the United States get vasectomies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s half the rate of men in Canada and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The low percentage comes despite the fact vasectomies are a significantly easier medical operation than tubal ligation or other procedures that women go through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vasectomies are an outpatient procedure and are performed at a doctor’s office under local anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The operation generally takes less than 30 minutes and the recovery time is usually a few days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vasectomies also have a high success rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sterilization procedures for women, on the other hand, are usually performed at a hospital or surgical center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re invasive surgery that’s done under general anesthesia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recovery is longer and usually requires an overnight stay after the operation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jesse Mills, the urologist and director of the men’s clinic at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), who did the procedure on the three fathers, said it makes senses for men to be the ones to undergo the surgery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said part of the reason men don’t get vasectomies in the United States is that the practice is much more engrained in other industrialized nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In other countries, it’s such a part of the norm,” Mills told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted that men in the United States don’t even go in for regular checkups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is part of a public health issue as well,” he said. “This is a huge part of how guys look at healthcare.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not a problem in Alaska&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. John Cullen delivers babies in the coastal community of Valdez in eastern Alaska.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also performs vasectomies. He’s done hundreds of them in the past 25 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cullen told Healthline he wasn’t surprised by the low percentage of U.S. men getting vasectomies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he said that’s not the case in the rugged town of Valdez.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s seems easier for men up here to do it,” said Cullen, who is a board member for the American Academy of Family Physicians. “They may not be as worried about their masculinity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another reason, Cullen says, is he makes birth control part of the discussion when parents come in to see him in the initial weeks after a child is born.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a good environment to have the discussion,” he said. “It’s a teachable moment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cullen has also done outreach to the community to educate people about vasectomies. He even occasionally offers free vasectomies as part of events such as the Valentine’s Day Dance at Prince William Sound College.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He tells men it’s an easy and effective form of birth control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s not a lot of long-term consequences,” Cullen said. “It’s an ideal form of contraception.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The long-time physician also emphasizes to men the importance of doing their part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think it’s important for men to take responsibility for their own contraception. It’s part of being an adult,” Cullen said. “I don’t think it’s fair for women to have all the responsibility on this.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Especially considering how easy the procedure is for men compared with women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For men not to step up to the plate is really fairly wimpy,” Cullen said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Doing their part&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diaz, Santangelo, and Lambrechts did not wimp out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The three men, who call themselves the “vascateers,” had all decided they were only going to have two children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lambrechts thought of the surgery first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I heard the surgery was a quick recovery, and she had already been through childbirth, so that was my contribution,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When they heard about Lambrechts’ plan, his two fellow fathers decided to join him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are a very close group of friends,” said Santangelo. “Our kids were born months apart. We've traveled together before kids, and now with kids, and we've shared some pretty awesome milestones together [but] we never thought we'd share this!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All three men said the outpatient surgery was easier than they’d thought it’d be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The procedure was done on a Friday afternoon, and by Sunday I was OK, and went to brunch with my family,” said Santangelo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trio decided to get the operation done right before the holidays since there would be plenty of sports on television while they recovered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They aren’t the first men to think of this strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies have shown an &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/03/16/vasectomies-%20during-march-madness/?xid=time_socialflow_%20twitter&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;uptick in vasectomies&lt;/a&gt; each year right before the NCAA basketball tournament in March.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea is you can recover while watching college basketball all day long.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Binging on sports, though, wasn’t the main motivation for the three friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I heard the surgery was a quick recovery and [my wife] had already been through childbirth, so that was my contribution,” said Lambrechts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We feel very blessed with the two girls we have,” added Diaz. “We're getting up there in the years and we're very comfortable with the two girls we have, so we just decided we didn't want any surprises down the road.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Guys don't really talk about this kind of thing that much,” noted Santangelo. “For us, we're all friends and are open with each other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Regenerative Stem Cell Treatment Offers Hope for People with Rheumatoid Arthritis

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/arthritis/031817_regenerativeRA_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A phase II stem cell treatment is the talk of the rheumatology community. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stem cell treatments have been a topic of conversation among many people with autoimmune and degenerative forms of arthritis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, an Australian pharmaceutical company is trying to figure out if this type of regenerative medicine could play a key role in treating or managing rheumatic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mesoblast.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mesoblast&lt;/a&gt; has developed a stem cell therapy that is administered intravenously to people with RA who didn’t experience success taking anti-TNF drugs like Remicade, Enbrel, and Humira.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The study results&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/02/15/917784/0/en/Durable-Responses-and-Sustained-Low-Disease-Activity-Over-Nine-Months-After-a-Single-Dose-of-Mesoblast-Cell-Therapy-in-Rheumatoid-Arthritis-Patients-Resistant-to-Anti-TNF-Agents.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phase II study&lt;/a&gt; followed 48 patients who received one injection of the stem cell therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These patients received therapeutic benefits as long as nine months after the initial dosing, company officials reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While more studies will be conducted in a phase III trial in order to validate the results, the results could mean positive things for the many people with RA who don’t fare well on TNF-inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anti-TNF drugs are a billion dollar industry as well as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2621374/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;source of relief&lt;/a&gt; for many people with RA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2669237/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;20 to 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people treated with these medications either have an adverse reaction, or find no relief.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best news for people with RA who are sensitive to medications or experience pharmacophobia is that unlike some other treatments, little toxicity or side effects were indicated in the studies of Mesoblast’s stem cell treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How the treatment works&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The treatment uses mesenchymal precursor cells (MCPs).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because the immune system doesn’t recognize these MCPs as foreign or invaders, they don’t tend to produce a negative response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The MCP cells are adult stem cells, not embryonic stem cells. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cells work because they contain certain receptors targeting the RA response and altering the way the body’s immune system works — or, in the sense of RA, the way it malfunctions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a published statement to the press from Mesoblast, “The way the cells work is, they have receptors on their surface that are activated by every major cytokine that is important in progressive rheumatoid arthritis, including TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-17. Those cytokines drive the disease and also bind to receptors on our cells. And when they bind to our cells they activate the cells to release other factors that switch off the very cells that made those cytokines.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There continues to be more research done on stem cell therapy as a way to treat immune, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, a company called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regenexx.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Regenexx&lt;/a&gt; shares some stem cell success stories on their website, often pertaining to healing osteoarthritis or injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While in the past, stem cells were only used to treat orthopedic injuries and conditions, newer research — like the targeted regenerative stem cell therapy that is being created by Mesoblast — also aims to treat other forms of arthritis like RA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

t;p&gt;You may not walk like an Egyptian, but you might want to eat like a Tsimane.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)30752-3/fulltext?elsca1=tlpr&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published today in The Lancet says the forager-horticulturist tribe in South America has the lowest reported levels of vascular aging of any population on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides the healthy heart conditions, these indigenous people of the Bolivian Amazon region also have low blood pressure, low cholesterol, and low blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers attributed these healthy qualities to the tribe’s high level of physical activity and its plant-based diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They concluded that the lack of this type of activity and diet in developed countries such as the United States should be added to the risks associated with heart problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The loss of subsistence diets and lifestyles could be classed as a new risk factor for vascular aging and we believe that components of this way of life could benefit contemporary sedentary populations,” said Hillard Kaplan, PhD, senior author and anthropology professor at the University of New Mexico, in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Katie Ferraro, a registered dietitian and assistant clinical professor at the University of San Diego and University of California, agrees with the assessment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We could certainly move in their direction,” Ferraro told Healthline. “We could look to them as models.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What researchers discovered&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers visited 85 Tsimane villages in 2014 and 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They took CT scans of the hearts of 705 village residents between the ages of 40 and 94.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They checked for hardening of the coronary arteries as well as the villagers’ height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, blood glucose, and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They discovered that 85 percent of Tsimane people had no risk of heart disease. That included two-thirds of the villagers who were 75 years or older.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another 13 percent of the tribe members had a low risk, while 3 percent had moderate or high risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A similar study of 6,814 people in the United States ages 45 to 84 showed that only 14 percent had no risk of heart disease. About 50 percent had a moderate or high risk. Another third had a low risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Tsimane population also had low heart rates and healthy levels of blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was despite the fact that about half of villagers did show elevated levels of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The inflammation common to the Tsimane was not associated with increased risk of heart disease and may instead be the result of high rates of infections,” said Dr. Randall Thompson, cardiologist at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers credited the villagers’ plant-based diet and physical activity level for their health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They noted that the Tsimane people spend only 10 percent of their waking hours being inactive. That compares with a 54 percent inactivity level in people in industrialized nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said hunting, fishing, gathering, and farming keep the men working six to seven hours a day, and the women working four to six hours a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also noted the Tismane people’s plant-rich diet, which is 72 percent carbohydrates, includes nonprocessed foods such as rice, corn, nuts, and fruits. Their diet is about 14 percent protein, coming from animal meat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smoking is also rare in these villages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How Americans can adapt&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ferraro said the activity level and the carbohydrate-rich diet were the two factors that stood out in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She noted high-carb diets are generally considered unhealthy in the United States, but that’s because Americans tend to get their carbohydrates from processed foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The villagers are eating the right carbohydrates,” said Ferraro, who teaches a cultural foods class at San Diego State University. “They’re a prescription for heart disease prevention.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kristin Kirkpatrick, MS, RD, LD, a licensed, registered dietitian who is a wellness manager at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute, agreed with that assessment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It shows that having a high-carb diet is not as bad as people think with the key point that their carbs were also loaded with fiber, something the body cannot digest,” Kirkpatrick told Healthline. “I've always recommended a ‘back to the basics’ approach to diet and this clearly shows the upside to that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both dietitians also pointed to the high activity level as another key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the physical activity factor here is huge,” said Kirkpatrick, “and for sure corresponds to the new studies showing that inactivity is as risky to health as obesity.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both acknowledge that Americans aren’t going to move to a tent in a national park and try to hunt game.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, they said there are ways people in modern societies can incorporate parts of the Tsimane lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is to significantly reduce the amount of processed foods in the diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mantra of fresh vegetables, fruits, and nuts is applicable here.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other is to lead a more active lifestyle, even for people who have desk jobs where they are sitting most of the workday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ferraro said it’s a good habit to get up every hour from your desk and be active for 5 to 7 minutes. You can even set a timer to remind you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That practice will add 45 minutes to an hour of exercise to your day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Make movement part of your daily routine,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Does it matter?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts who talked to Healthline say it does — from the ability to have a relationship to maintaining good mental health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://newscenter.sdsu.edu/sdsu_newscenter/news_story.aspx?sid=76628&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-017-0953-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Archives of Sexual Behavior &lt;/a&gt;found that people in the United States who were living together or married had sex less often between 2010 and 2014 compared with those who were together from 2000 to 2004.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This includes millennials, too. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jean M. Twenge, the 2017 study's lead author, and professor of psychology at San Diego State University, conducted research last year that found millennials had fewer sexual partners than Gen Xers. She is the author of “Generation Me: Why Today's Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled — and More Miserable Than Ever Before.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Despite their reputation for hooking up, millennials and the generation after them (known as iGen or Generation Z) are actually having sex less often than their parents and grandparents did when they were young,” Twenge said in a statement. “That's partially because fewer iGeners and millennials have steady partners.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Understanding millennials and sex&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-016-0798-z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016 research&lt;/a&gt; found that 15 percent of 20- to 24-year-olds born in the 1990s had not had any sexual partners since age 18, compared to only 6 percent of Gen Xers when they were young adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twenge says the numbers aren’t indicative of the stereotype of the generation that they have a lot of sex with multiple partners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Online dating apps should, in theory, help millennials find sexual partners more easily,” Twenge said in a statement. “However, technology may have the opposite effect if young people are spending so much time online that they interact less in person, and thus don’t have sex.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jenni Skyler, a certified sex therapist, sexologist, and a licensed marriage and family therapist with The Intimacy Institute in Colorado, said that electronic distractions are one reason why young people may have sex less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also other barriers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People lay in bed on their tablets or phones, isolated from one another in an electronic medium that can be almost addictive. At least when people were lying in bed before with just the TV as a barrier, they could cuddle and watch the same show, upping the odds for sensual contact,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tammy Nelson, a certified sex therapist and licensed couples’ counselor, who wrote&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;The New Monogamy&lt;em&gt;,” &lt;/em&gt;told Healthline&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that technology may play a factor in how millennials approach sex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They may depend on pornography, social media, or cyber relationships for instant gratification and uncomplicated relationships. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Perhaps cyber relationships and even sex with themselves or virtual partners is easier, faster, and less complicated than with their real life committed partner or spouse,” Nelson explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If that is the case, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they are any less happy than other generations, she added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The ramifications of less sex&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In her 2016 study, Twenge noted that 45 percent of millennials had slept with someone other than a partner or spouse when they were in their late teens or 20s. That’s up from 35 percent of Gen Xers at the same age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It's hard to say if millennials’ rate of sexual frequency will increase once they get into relationships,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People getting married at age 30 may have less sex than if they’d married at 22 like baby boomers did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Millennials are more likely to spend their years of peak sexual frequency without a steady partner, which might cut down on their total lifetime sexual frequency,” Twenge said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While they may be having sex less often, more of them are sleeping with people they are not “in a relationship” with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does it put millennials more at risk for sexual health complications?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2016/std-surveillance-report-2015-press-release.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016 CDC report&lt;/a&gt; noted a rise in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia (up 6 percent since 2014), syphilis (up 19 percent), and gonorrhea (up nearly 13 percent).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nearly 20 million new STI cases happen each year, the CDC says, and more than half of those are in people ages 15 to 24.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some experts say that &lt;a href=&quot;http://nypost.com/2016/11/02/millennials-arent-wearing-condoms-anymore/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;social media and technology&lt;/a&gt; has fueled this phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Ryne Sherman, an associate professor at Florida Atlantic University who co-authored the 2016 study, said sexual frequency is tied to mental and physical health, though it is tough to confirm that more sex causes greater health, or if greater health causes more sex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He suspects that it goes both ways. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our results are very consistent with the view that mental health is a real problem for millennials [compared with previous generations],” Sherman told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Fran Walfish, a family and relationship psychotherapist based in California, said the less-sex trend could be problematic for marriages — assuming that millennials still have less sex if they do marry. She noted a trend of young people in their 20s and 40s are in sexless marriages. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Lack of sex has many causes, including ‘we just had a baby,’ to being worn out by the kids, financial strain, or career demands. No matter the cause, at the root is a common denominator. Lack of communication,” Walfish told Healthline. “And, when marital communication breaks down, sex falls apart. Divorce often ensues.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Millennials also aren’t as focused on marriage and children, and aren’t taking these steps as did the generations before them, she added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those that do marry and try to have kids later on could face age-related pregnancy risks and infertility issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Safer sex?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twenge has said that millennials are “very interested in safety, which also appears in their reduced use of alcohol and their interest in ‘safe spaces’ on campus.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is a very risk-averse generation, and that attitude may be influencing their sexual choices,” Twenge noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Millennials do not have drastically fewer sex partners and drastically lower sexual frequency, just lower than other generations given their age and the time in which they live, Sherman added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Millennials could be one of the safest generations when it comes to sex, he contended. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC reports in its Youth Risk Behavior Survey, that 41 percent of high school students had engaged in sex in 2015, down from 54 percent in 1991. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This generation appears to be waiting longer to have sex, with an increasing minority apparently waiting until their early 20s or later,” said Twenge. “It’s good news for sexual and emotional health if teens are waiting until they are ready. But if young adults forgo sex completely, they may be missing out on some of the advantages of an adult romantic relationship.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How much sex aren’t we having?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Americans also had sex about nine fewer times each year from 2010 through 2014 compared with 1995-1999, the 2017 report found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data was derived from the General Social Survey, which includes 26,000 adult participants who were asked about their sexual behaviors since 1989.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These data show a major reversal from previous decades in terms of marriage and sex,” said Twenge in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is true, older and married people do, in fact, have sex less often. This may or may not correlate to age, being tired, or boredom with a long-term partnership,” Nelson said. “But for the ‘older’ people today, sexual frequency declines, but sex also improves as we age.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We get better in bed as we get older,” Nelson added. “We don’t measure sexual performance by the notches on our belts, but with the level of intimacy, the quality of eroticism, the variety, the fantasies we share with a partner, our capacity for helping our partner to orgasm, the loss of body image insecurities, and the delight and pleasure we find in the act of sex itself.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nelson encourages young people not to be dissuaded by the report. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Sex is not going away. We are biologically created to seek pleasure, to be in partnerships of all kinds,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People are living longer, healthier lives and can still enjoy sex later in life. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Focus on sex, at any age, can bring intimacy and rewards for a lifetime,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/autism/031617_autismdiagnosis_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers say they have uncovered a relatively easy and accurate way to tell early on whether a young child has autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers say metabolic biomarkers in the blood can help medical personnel assess whether a child is on the autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say this early detection method could allow for earlier diagnosis of autism and perhaps better treatment of the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005385&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; were published today in the journal PLOS Computational Biology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What biomarkers reveal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their study, scientists used blood sample data collected at Arkansas Children’s Hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They looked at the samples from 83 children diagnosed with autism and 76 children classified as neurotypical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All were between the ages of 3 and 10.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said they noticed concentrations of specific substances formed by metabolic processes in the blood of children with autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They said their method correctly classified 97 percent of the children with autism and 96 percent of the neurotypical children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The method presented in this work is the only one of its kind that can classify an individual as being on the autism spectrum or as being neurotypical,” Juergen Hahn, PhD, a study author, and professor of biomedical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, said in a press statement. “We are not aware of any other method, using any type of biomarker, that can do this, much less with the degree of accuracy that we see in our work.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Eugene Arnold, a professor emeritus in the department of psychiatry and behavioral health at the Wexner Medical Center at The Ohio State University, agreed the research findings are important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said they could be used to help with diagnosis, treatment, and even prevention in autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a good advancement in the field,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why the findings are important&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1 in 68 children&lt;/a&gt; in the United States (about 1.5 percent) have autism, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exact cause of the condition is still unknown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study authors said previous research has revealed certain differences in metabolic processes in children with autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, they said, medical professionals have struggled to transfer this knowledge into diagnostic tools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hahn said further research is needed, but his team is hopeful the early biomarker diagnosis could lead to treatments that would alter the metabolic processes and reduce autism symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arnold said if that research actually pans out, it could be an important development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said there are theories that autism can be affected by both genes and a child’s environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A child who is born with DNA that makes them more likely to develop autism can have those genes activated by outside sources, including their diet or their mother’s diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/features/folicacidbenefits/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has indicated that a healthy amount of folic acid, for example, can help reduce the possibility of birth defects involving the brain and the spine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arnold said that it’s uncertain whether vaccines could fall into the category of an outside influence that can trigger autism-related genes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure it’s completely relevant,” he said. “There’s not good evidence that vaccines cause autism in general.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arnold noted if a child is diagnosed early with autism, then perhaps a change in diet or other factors could help alleviate symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He did caution that the 97 percent accuracy rate should be improved with this diagnostic method. He said that even a high accuracy rate when dealing with only 1.5 percent of a population can lead to a tripling of mistaken diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need to be careful that there isn’t a lot of false positives,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early detection from friends, family&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The importance of detecting autism early is the center of another &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1362361316679632?journalCode=auta&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers say they discovered that family members and friends who have consistent contact with a child can alert parents to the possibility of autistic behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their study, the researchers conducted an online survey of 477 parents of children with autism. They also did a follow-up survey of 196 friends and family members referred by the parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the surveys, 25 percent of parents said that other individuals indicated their child might have a serious condition before they suspected it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, more than 50 percent of the friends and family members reported they suspected a child had a serious condition before parents noticed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of those, half of the friends and family told parents of their concerns while the other half didn’t, or only hinted at their suspicions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said the individuals who most frequently noticed the children’s condition were grandmothers and teachers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In those instances, children were diagnosed with autism as many as five months earlier than children whose parents weren’t notified by friends or family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, children with older siblings were diagnosed as many as 10 months earlier than children without siblings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said an earlier diagnosis can help improve treatment for children with autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Many parents avoid seeking help to find a diagnosis for their child, even though they sense something might be wrong,” said Nachum Sicherman, a study co-author, and professor of business at Columbia Business School, in a press release. “They often ignore signs of a larger problem and look the other way, making the role of close family members and friends vital to accelerating diagnosis and helping a child’s condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/food-fads/031617_antisocialdiet_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Picture your last meal at a restaurant with friends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plates loaded with delicious food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People laughing and telling stories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wine glasses filled and refilled over the course of the meal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good time, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure. But researchers say there’s a downside to all that social revelry, especially if you are trying to lose weight, or even just keep off the pounds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research has found that the urge to overeat is strongest when you are dining with others in social situations, especially when out at a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The biggest source of temptation is when people are in restaurants and they’re with other people. In particular, being with others who are eating is a huge trigger,” Lora Burke, PhD, MPH, the study’s lead author, and a professor of nursing at the University of Pittsburgh, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it’s not just your friends who can lead your diet astray.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People can feel food temptation “even if they’re alone but are in sight of people who are eating,” said Burke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Increasing temptation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/4693702/diet-weight-loss-food-restaurant/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;year-long study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used a smartphone app to follow 150 people enrolled in a weight loss program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The app asked people to check in up to five times a day, reporting whether they were tempted to stray from their eating plan, or if they actually did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, they reported where they were, who they were with, and their mood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout the day they also reported whenever they ate — or thought about eating — foods or portion sizes that didn’t fit their plan. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And they weighed themselves every day on a digital scale that sent data to the researchers automatically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hl-poll&quot; style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px;&quot;&gt; &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9696069.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://polldaddy.com/poll/9696069/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Where are you most tempted to go off your diet?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This use of technology in the study allowed researchers to capture information in real time, rather than relying on people to remember details later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We assessed them in the moment,” said Burke. “They’re in their natural environment — wherever they are — and they let us know what they’re doing, rather than relying on recall.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The amount of data provided some hints at how people react to food temptations in different situations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People were more tempted when they were in the presence of other people eating, compared with eating alone — even if they were sitting near strangers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also reported more food temptations when they were at a restaurant or bar, rather than at home or work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And they were less likely to be tempted when eating in their car or at another person’s house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not every meal with friends at a restaurant leads down the path of temptation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the study found out that when people were tempted at a restaurant and were around others who were eating, “at least 60 percent of the time they will go on and eat something that they really weren’t planning for,” Burke said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chance of giving in to temptation at work or in the car was about 40 percent and 30 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study was presented at a recent meeting of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://professional.heart.org/professional/EducationMeetings/MeetingsLiveCME/EPILifestyle/UCM_316904_EPI-Lifestyle-Scientific-Sessions.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mindful eating&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So is locking yourself in your house with a bowl of salad and ignoring your friends’ text messages your best option?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not quite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though eating at a restaurant with friends can be a high-risk situation, friends can actually help you stick to your weight loss plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other research found that people who received &lt;a href=&quot;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.849.558&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more social support&lt;/a&gt; were better able to keep the weight off. As were people who enrolled in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;amp;id=1999-00242-015&amp;amp;_ga=1.18664253.546971615.1489603865&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weight loss program with friends&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plus, the new study found that even though people experienced fewer food temptations when they were at home, they still gave into them about half of the time. Even when they were alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So food temptation lies in wait in many places. As do distractions — which some think may be behind our overeating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People often overeat when they’re distracted — social situations can be distracting, of course,” Dan Zigmond, author of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buddhasdiet.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Buddha’s Diet: The Ancient Art of Losing Weight Without Losing Your Mind&lt;/a&gt;,” told Healthline. “But sitting alone at your desk at work can be hugely distracting, as well. And there’s lots of evidence that people make bad choices in that situation, too.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can counteract the effect of these distractions by being more mindful while you eat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This technique has been applied in successful &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1499404611002648&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weight loss programs&lt;/a&gt;. But its roots extend even further back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Part of the theme of our book is to carry forward the teachings that Buddha presented so many years ago. Those really all boil down to just paying attention,” said Zigmond. “To try to ensure that you’re always paying some attention to what you’re eating, no matter where you’re doing it, when you’re doing it, or with whom.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zigmond said that this works even in groups, as seen with Buddhist monks who eat their meals communally, and mindfully.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mindful eating mind might mean something as simple as pausing for a moment before starting to eat. Or paying attention to each bite of food. Or talking about the food with your friends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, this can improve the dining experience for everyone, without leaving you feeling guilty afterward for overeating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think meals out with friends have to be bad for our health or our weight,” said Zigmond. “But we have to combine them with a certain amount of attention and mindfulness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

p&gt;Can simply eating less food periodically cure someone of diabetes?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Can such a diet cause cells that have been hampered from producing insulin to start producing it again?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At least one researcher seems to think so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthy diets have long been promoted as a way of lowering your risk of diabetes, and a careful diet is necessary for avoiding blood sugar spikes for those who already have the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Valter Longo, PhD, the director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California (USC) Leonard Davis School of Gerontology, has long been a proponent of the fasting diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cell.com/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)30130-7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published late last month in the journal Cell, Longo and fellow researchers concluded a fasting diet promoted the growth of new pancreatic cells, which help produce insulin, in mice with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human cells exposed to the diet in a dish also produced increased insulin, suggesting it could alleviate diabetes in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Longo hopes to begin human trials of the fasting diet later this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Questions, potential conflicts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of questions left to be answered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is whether only a portion of patients — perhaps those who recently developed diabetes and haven’t been insulin-deficient as long — respond to the diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t know,” Longo told Healthline. “We’ll see if the only ones who respond are the more recent ones — or nobody.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Longo, who also partially owns a food company that sells meal plans to help people who want to follow a fast-mimicking diet. He’s conducted past research that has found this type of diet might reduce the risk for cancer, heart disease, and other age-related ailments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those ties also raise some questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Any time it seems like something can fix everything, that’s always a worry. And then when there’s products involved,” says Deborah Greenwood, PhD, RN, president of Deborah Greenwood Consulting, specializing in diabetes and digital health, and past president of the American Association of Diabetes Educators. “But I wouldn’t want to say something is bad just because it’s unique. We just need long-term studies with a significant amount of people.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other recent research has also raised the possibility of reversing diabetes through diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another short-term study, &lt;a href=&quot;http://diabetes.jmir.org/2017/1/e5/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published last week&lt;/a&gt;, found that 10 weeks of a personalized, ketogenic diet that was overseen remotely by medical professionals led to improved control over blood sugar levels and weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ketogenic diet includes low amounts of carbohydrates, which have the most impact on blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that study, backed by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtahealth.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new start-up&lt;/a&gt; that calls itself an “online specialty medical clinic that reverses type 2 diabetes without medications or surgery,” has product ties, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I never liked the word ‘reversal’ in terms of diabetes,” Greenwood told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She says the only way to truly reverse it would be bariatric surgery, in which a portion of the stomach or intestines is removed. But she says she knows people with diabetes who have followed a ketogenic diet and love it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s just really hard to live in the world and engage in typical life when you’re so restricted, and there’s no long-term data to show if it’s sustainable or healthy,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cells and behavior&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Greenwood said Longo’s study could be different because it suggests it could be possible to change a person’s cells not simply behavior, as in the ketogenic study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it would still likely require some behavior changes because of the careful monitoring required by the new diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most people who are on insulin are highly engaged, and some aren’t,” she said. “My guess would be someone who would take on a rigid diet would be engaged. But maybe not. The mice didn’t have to do too much in their lives. They didn’t have to go to work. They had fairly easy routines.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Undertaking those sorts of diets on your own — particularly if you’re dependent on insulin medication — can be dangerous, although even before these studies there were a number of claims online of people using fasting or starvation diets to reduce the impacts of the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for his formula, Longo wouldn’t say what exactly the diet consists of.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t talk about the diets because we don’t want people to improvise at home,” he told Healthline. “It’s quite dangerous the way it’s done right now for diabetic patients, especially those on insulin.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Human trials, he says, would be undertaken in a hospital setting with careful oversight and protocols.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But his goal is to one day have the diet approved for home use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He describes a box with strict instructions that people could take home, although it still wouldn’t likely be available to those using insulin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, however the research advances, the best diet will still be the one that helps keep diabetes at bay in the first place. Experts say avoiding processed carbs, sugary drinks, and red meat as much as possible is a great start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/031517_babydeaths_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern medicine has made significant advancements in the care and treatment available to humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cancer is no longer the death sentence it was once deemed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AIDS and HIV are considered treatable diseases now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even the surgery required to clear clogged arteries is about two steps away from being an outpatient procedure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, despite these scientific breakthroughs, there is one health issue that remains a troubling trend across our planet: Infant deaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each year approximately one million infants die on the day they are born, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savethechildren.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=8rKLIXMGIpI4E&amp;amp;b=8943305&amp;amp;ct=13664839&amp;amp;notoc=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014 report&lt;/a&gt;, Ending Newborn Deaths, from the Save the Children Foundation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The number was highlighted again this year when Bill and Melinda Gates mentioned the findings in their foundation’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatesnotes.com/2017-Annual-Letter?WT.mc_id=02_14_2017_00_AL2017_IN-YT_&amp;amp;WT.tsrc=INYT&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;annual letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A variety of reasons&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say infant deaths occurs in both developing nations and industrialized nations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a variety of causes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some infants who die on their first day of life succumb to birth defects, said Dr. Jose Cordero, MPH, of the University of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But ultimately, most deaths can be traced back to the type of healthcare that pregnant women have access to. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we’re really talking about is what you have at the local level,” Cordero told Healthline. “It has to do with prenatal care, and it has to with delivery with an appropriately trained attendant.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In developing nations medical care for pregnant women is usually administered by midwives or healthcare attendants, compared with industrialized nations where doctors and nurses commonly provide care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Save the Children report states, “half of first-day deaths around the world could be prevented if the mother and baby had access to free healthcare and a skilled midwife.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Infant deaths occur when these attendants haven’t received proper training in emergency life-saving procedures, according to Cordero. This can include resuscitation, if the baby is born not breathing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Save the Children report, “skilled care during labor could reduce the number of stillbirths during labor by 45 percent and prevent 43 percent of newborn deaths.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adequate training can teach healthcare attendants how to identify high-risk pregnancies, Cordero noted. Conditions like placenta previa, a ruptured placenta, or preeclampsia can lead to complications for the baby and the mother.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A healthcare attendant that has the training to detect any early stage complications can “recognize that because of these complications [the mother] needs a higher level of care,” such as a hospital,” Cordero said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from pregnant and delivery care, birth defects are also a major factor in infant death, he noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of these birth defects, such as spina bifida, may be prevented if pregnant women ingest enough folic acid. For example, women could eat wheat products that are fortified with this important vitamin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a simple solution that isn’t standard practice throughout the world. And not just in developing nations, Cordero added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Only about one-third of the flour in the world is fortified, so a lot of progress can be made,” he said. “The U.K. still is not doing it.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;High infant death rate in the U.S.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United States does fortify its flour supply. However, the country still struggles to improve its infant death rate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr63/nvsr63_05.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014 report&lt;/a&gt; by the National Center for Health Statistics compared the infant death rates of 22 industrialized countries. The United States came in last.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As in developing countries, infant death rates in the United States are also tied to access to healthcare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s about economic and social conditions that women struggle with every day,” Alicia Leatherman, director of Infant Wellness at Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH), told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Columbus, Ohio, where NCH is located, African-American babies are two times more likely than Caucasian babies to die in their first year. The county is working to reduce that number through a program called “Celebrate One,” which was rolled out in 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to decrease infant mortality rates by 40 percent,” Leatherman said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The program takes into consideration a host of situations and scenarios that hinder access to prenatal care. They include neighborhood conditions, smoking, and even the spacing between pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2014, the county’s infant death rate was 8.4 percent. By 2015 that number dropped to 7.7 percent. However, Leatherman said preliminary numbers for 2016 show an uptick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said they suspect that some of these deaths are due to prematurity or sleep related issues caused by situations such as co-sleeping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are many different reasons,” Leatherman said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even so, the county is pleased with the response that the program has received.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen an increase in getting [pregnant women] into prenatal care, early,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there is still much to be done when it comes to infant death rates, both Leatherman and Cordero say there has been significant improvement in access to prenatal care for women throughout the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Twenty years ago, our concern was there were a million babies in Africa alone that were dying of measles,” Cordero said. “So, a lot of progress has been made.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/031517_blindstemcell_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That may be especially true when it comes to experimental treatments involving stem cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the warning out today from researchers who looked into a purported medical trial at a Florida clinic that left three older women blind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said there were plenty of warning signs about the experimental treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These included the fact patients paid $5,000 to participate, and the trial had no control group or previous research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings will be published tomorrow in The New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“[The paper is a] call to awareness for patients, physicians, and regulatory agencies of the risks of this kind of minimally regulated, patient-funded research,” said Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, professor and chair of ophthalmology at the Stanford University School of Medicine, and co-author of the paper, in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How women were blinded&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The stem cell treatments happened in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The treatment was listed on &lt;a href=&quot;https://clinicaltrials.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; as a “study to assess the safety and effects of cells injected intravitreal in dry macular degeneration.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is a common, progressive disease of the retina that leads to loss of vision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The clinical trials website is overseen by the U.S. National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which oversees the medical library, did not respond to Healthline’s request for an interview.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study authors said people may have signed up thinking they were going to be part of a trial. However, the written material that accompanied the website listing did not mention a trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The three women who were blinded ranged in age from 72 to 88, and each suffered from macular degeneration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before the experimental surgery, their eyesight ranged from 20/30 to 20/200, uncorrected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the clinic, which was not named in the research paper, the patients had fat cells removed from their abdomens. The fat tissue was then processed with enzymes with the goal of obtaining stem cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Platelet-dense plasma was isolated from blood drawn from the patients. The cells were then mixed with the platelet-dense plasma and injected into the eyes. Patients reported that the entire process took less than an hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after, the three female patients experienced side effects that included vision loss, detached retinas, and hemorrhages. They are now blind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas Albini, a study co-author, and an associate professor of clinical ophthalmology at the University of Miami, where two of the patients were subsequently treated, said the women will probably remain blind for the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Although I can't say it's impossible, it's extremely unlikely they would regain vision,” he said in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Albini said the blindness could have been caused by the injection of a contaminant or the cell wash solution into the eye. When injected into the eye, the stem cells also could have changed into myofibroblasts, a type of cell associated with scarring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study authors said that even if the procedure have been properly done, there is no evidence the surgery would have improved the women’s vision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of very well-founded evidence for the positive potential of stem therapy for many human diseases, but there's no excuse for not designing a trial properly and basing it on preclinical research,” Goldberg said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lots of warning signs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study authors said there were plenty of “red flags” on this particular medical offering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first was the lack of information on the site about a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There was also no hypothesis based on laboratory experiments, assignment of a control group and treatment group, collection of data, masking of clinical and patient groups, and plans for follow-up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;There was a whole list of egregious things,&quot; said Albini.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next warning sign was the request for patients to pay $5,000 for the treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I'm not aware of any legitimate research, at least in ophthalmology, that is patient-funded,&quot; Albini said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another tip-off was the fact the surgeons operated on both eyes at the same time. The study authors said professionals working in legitimate clinical trials would usually operate on one eye at a time to make sure the treatment is working properly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There's a lot of hope for stem cells and these types of clinics appeal to patients desperate for care who hope that stem cells are going to be the answer, but in this case these women participated in a clinical enterprise that was off-the-charts dangerous,” Albini said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study authors noted that listings on ClinicalTrials.gov are not fully scrutinized for scientific soundness. This particular listing is still on the site, but now states: “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/results/NCT02024269&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This study has been withdrawn prior to enrollment.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The clinic is also no longer performing these eye injections, although it is still seeing patients, Albini said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The procedure was also not subject to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval because the cells were not transferred between patients and were considered “minimally processed,” the study authors noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors recommended that people considering participation in a clinical trial check a website, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.closerlookatstemcells.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Closer Look at Stem Cells&lt;/a&gt;, for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They can also investigate whether a trial is affiliated with an academic medical center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/031517_childbraininjuries_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/get_the_facts.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the number one cause of disability and death among children and adolescents in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This particularly true for children under 4 years of age and teens between 15 and 19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biausa.org/brain-injury-children.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that TBIs are particularly traumatic for children, as they impact the child’s brain development and can cause serious cognitive impairment over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Negative effects include a decline in reasoning and trouble processing information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of these adverse effects are not obvious right away. They may come up later when the children advance in age and are faced with different cognitive challenges. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research - published in Neurology, the journal of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) - suggests that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newswise.com/articles/which-kids-will-take-longer-to-recover-from-brain-injury&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a new biomarker&lt;/a&gt; may help anticipate which children will have more trouble recovering from a TBI and consequently require more aggressive treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emily L. Dennis, Ph.D., of the University of Southern California (USC) and one of the authors of the new study, explains the motivation behind the research:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of disability in children, but it is very difficult to predict long-term outcome and which kids might need more aggressive treatment,” she said. “While the severity of the injury certainly plays a role in this, there is still a lot of uncertainty - you frequently have two patients with similar injuries who have different recoveries.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Studying the impact&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study looked at 21 children aged between 8 and 18 who had been admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit in a Los Angeles County hospital as a result of a moderate to severe TBI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reasons for the brain injury included traffic accidents as well as falls from skateboards or bikes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study also used a control group of 20 children who did not experience TBI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers examined the patients’ brain by using a special type of imaging device called a diffusion-weighted MRI. They scanned the patients’ brain two to five months after the injury and then again 12 months later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists also administered reasoning and memory tests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, they examined the patients’ brain using an electroencephalogram as they were completing a pattern-matching task that focused on the time it takes for their brain to transfer information from one hemisphere to another.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team focused on this aspect of brain activity because previous studies had shown that both children and adults who had TBI exhibit slower transfer times immediately after the injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Slow transfer time&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a few months after the injury, half of the children with TBI had slow transfer time while half had a normal transfer time – that is, within the same range as the healthy control group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the slow-transfer half of the TBI group, the scans revealed disruptions in the white matter that connects the two hemispheres of the brain, called the corpus callosum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These disruptions worsened between the first scan and the second one, which took place a year later. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By contrast, the half of the TBI group that had normal transfer time did not reveal any differences from the control group in their brain scans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, as Dennis explains: “The TBI slow-transfer time group showed progressive decline during this period, while the other group showed signs of recovery.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, the reasoning and memory tests also revealed poorer scores in the TBI slow-transfer group, compared with the normal-transfer TBI group and the control group. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Significance of the study &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the study sample was small and the findings need to be confirmed by larger studies, the current results point to the disruption in the white matter as a reliable biomarker for predicting the children who will have more trouble recovering from a TBI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The finding in this study that there is degeneration of white matter in about half of the children with moderate to severe TBI during the first 16 months after an injury should stimulate attempts to understand why this is happening so that treatments may be developed to lessen this progressive decline in white matter,” said Dennis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Bradley L. Schlaggar, Ph.D., of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and a member of the AAN, also commented on the significance of the study in an accompanying editorial:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study is an important step forward to identifying a functional biomarker that may predict the trajectory of TBI recovery,” he said.“Success in confirming these results would be transformative for the field. We need tools that will allow us to make individual predictions so we can make the best decisions about treatment and how to educate and counsel our patients and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the early days of the administration, but President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress have already taken aim at the country’s healthcare legislation, immigration policy, and environmental regulation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Is “Death with Dignity” (DwD) in the crosshairs, too?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes called medical aid-in-dying or physician-assisted suicide, these laws allow doctors to prescribe lethal medication to terminally ill patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The issue has mostly been decided at the state level, but the federal government has weighed in before and could do so again. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, two clues suggest there is some opposition to aid-in-dying on the federal level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In February, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/2017/02/13/826001a2-f208-11e6-a9b0-ecee7ce475fc_story.html?utm_term=.4f1c05912921&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;House committee&lt;/a&gt; voted to block Washington D.C.’s Death with Dignity Act (DWDA), which the district's council had approved late last year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Since the Constitution charges Congress with legislative jurisdiction over Washington D.C., Congress has a duty to carefully scrutinize this bill, its impact on medical patients, and its effects on our health-care system,” Reps. Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) and Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalreview.com/article/444573/washington-dc-death-dignity-act-assisted-suicde-health-care-costs-compassion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in the National Review. “We have weighed the legislation and found it wanting.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arguing that the law opens up too many avenues for abuse, Wenstrup and others sponsored resolutions of dissent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These resolutions fizzled out, but the law could be held up during budget proceedings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stepping on the states&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congress does have jurisdiction over Washington, D.C., but in general it usually doesn't review laws passed by states and municipalities. However, there are other ways for the feds to step in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2001, a few years after Oregon’s DWDA went into effect, Attorney General John Ashcroft &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/04-623&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that dispensing lethal medication to terminally ill patients was not a legitimate medical use of a drug. He said doctors who went along with the Oregon law were therefore in violation of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Ashcroft directive was ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court, not because the judges found his interpretation unreasonable, but because they ruled in a 6-3 decision the attorney general did not have the authority to make such a decision. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arthur Svenson, a political science professor at the University of Redlands in California, thinks the CSA could be invoked again as a means of overturning DWDA laws.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Congress, if it wants to, could clarify [the CSA] in a single sentence, and here’s how it would read: [physician assisted suicide] is not a legitimate medical purpose. Period,” he told Healthline. “The effect of that clarification of the law by Congress would mean that if you were a doctor in those six states that legalized assisted suicide you’d go to jail” for prescribing lethal medication.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Would Republicans be willing to do that? Maybe. Would Trump be willing to sign that law? Maybe.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With clear instruction from Congress, any opposition to DwD laws from the Attorney General Jeff Sessions would be much easier to defend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Secular vs. sectarian&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the flip side, Svenson can also envision a way — a “little crack in the door” — for aid-in-dying to become the law of the land. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are five people on the [Supreme Court] currently who don’t accept religiously inspired justifications for existing laws. They need valid secular reasons, not valid sectarian reasons,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That aversion to enacting laws based on religious principles led to the court’s legalization of sodomy and same-sex marriage, he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Is it possible that you could return to the court and argue that the reasons why state governments have banned Death with Dignity were fundamentally religious inspired?” he said. “If you remove your religious reasons for banning Death with Dignity, what secular reasons remain in the wake?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the Oregon law was enacted in 1997, about 1,500 people have requested lethal prescriptions and two-thirds have chosen to take them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The state has reported no abuses of the law so far, although its communication strategy — informing terminally ill patients of their right to access lethal drugs alongside the news that it was denying them further healthcare coverage — caused a major public relations dustup. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It dropped my chin to the floor,” Randy Stroup, who learned that the Oregon Health Plan would not pay for experimental cancer treatment but would pay for lethal drugs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/07/28/oregon-offers-terminal-patients-doctor-assisted-suicide-instead-medical-care.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; FOX News in 2008. “[How could they] not pay for medication that would help my life, and yet offer to pay to end my life?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://nypost.com/2016/10/24/terminally-ill-mom-denied-treatment-coverage-but-gets-suicide-drugs-approved/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;similar case&lt;/a&gt; in California, which approved its own DwD law in 2016, drew national attention and outrage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In these examples, opponents of the law found evidence for exactly what they had feared: Insurance companies were approving death as a cheaper option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supporters of the law argue that these patients would have been denied coverage with or without the law. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Keeping it at the state level&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite Svenson’s hope that Oregon’s clean record could encourage a victory for the movement, DwD proponents are unlikely to push the law at the federal level any time soon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For one thing, President Trump’s Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch is known to oppose the practice. In 2006, he published “The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia,” an extension of his dissertation work at Oxford. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/02/01/neil-gorsuch-wrote-the-book-on-assisted-suicide-heres-what-he-said/?utm_term=.b0061843b1f2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;, he concludes that “[H]uman life is fundamentally and inherently valuable, and that the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Right to Life Committee, which advocates against abortion as well as aid-in-dying, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nrlc.org/communications/releases/2017/release013117/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;praised&lt;/a&gt; Gorsuch’s nomination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Barbara Coombs Lee, president of the aid-in-dying advocacy group Compassion &amp;amp; Choices, doesn’t think the addition of Gorsuch to the Supreme Court will change the composition of the court radically enough to sway its standing on DwD laws one way or the other. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gorsuch is seen as an “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/who-is-neil-gorsuch-bio-facts-background-political-views-234437&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;intellectual heir&lt;/a&gt;” to the late Antonin Scalia, whose seat he will fill if confirmed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, pursuing federal approval is just not the strategy advocates are taking right now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s full steam ahead for states,” Coombs Lee told Healthline. “The fact of the matter is that the U.S. Supreme Court has a harder time revoking what has come to be a cultural value in the United States.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The legalization of DwD laws in California could cause such a shift. That law made the option for terminally ill people to take lethal drugs newly available to 1 in 8 Americans, Svenson points out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It will be telling, don’t you think, if no abuse is located in the state of California,” Svenson said.&amp;nbsp; “I think if enough states said yes then we will return to the Supreme Court and maybe make the argument again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Laws and opposition&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two 1997 Supreme Court decisions denied a constitutional right to aid-in-dying but kicked the issue back to the states for further debate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Besides Oregon, California, and Washington D.C. — Colorado, Washington, and Vermont have all legalized DwD through voter referendum or legislative action. In Montana, the practical is also legal following a 2009 state Supreme Court &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/01/us/01suicide.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of these places follow the example set by Oregon. The option is only available to mentally competent adults with less than six months to live who are capable of taking the medication themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No state has sanctioned &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_EKwSXOsVE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assisted suicide&lt;/a&gt;, a practice advocated by Dr. Jack Kevorkian, which requires a doctor to administer lethal doses of drugs via IV or injection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But many disability, religious, and medical groups still oppose the law. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In a society that prizes physical ability and stigmatizes impairments, it’s no surprise that previously able-bodied people may tend to equate disability with loss of dignity,” writes the disability rights group Not Dead Yet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This reflects the prevalent but insulting societal judgment that people who deal with incontinence and other losses in bodily function are lacking dignity. People with disabilities are concerned that these psycho-social disability-related factors have become widely accepted as sufficient justification for assisted suicide.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Providing care&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the debate centers on making this option legal and safe for physicians and their patients, many medical professionals remain uneasy about it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of doctors surveyed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/ethics2016-part2#page=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medscape&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, 29 percent were opposed to physician aid-in-dying, although that number had dropped from 41 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Palliative care experts don’t want the debate to eclipse the larger issue of appropriate treatment and pain relief for terminally ill patients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“[The International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care (IAHPC)] believes that no country or state should consider the legalization of euthanasia or PAS until it ensures universal access to palliative care services and to appropriate medications, including opioids for pain and dyspnea,” the group wrote in a statement published online late last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a conversation with Healthline, Liliana De Lima, the group’s executive director, explained that access to appropriate care at the end of life is not guaranteed for many people in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Actually there’s discussion in India right now about euthanasia, and the people in India that we work with have raised this concern,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may be “easier and less expensive to say, ‘OK, let’s go for euthanasia or assisted suicide,’ and right now the vast majority of people in India don’t have access to palliative care,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, access to such care is uneven. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://reportcard.capc.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; generated by the Center to Advance Palliative Care found that people who die in the southern United States or in for-profit hospitals are less likely to receive adequate end-of-life care.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like Not Dead Yet, IAHPC eschews the term “death with dignity.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen a lot of people dying with good palliative care in a very dignified manner,” De Lima said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vigilant groups&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Washington D.C. politics set to boil and members of Congress vowing to filibuster Gorsuch, groups concerned about aid-in-dying are setting their sights at the local level. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here in Oregon we’re still really concerned about advocating for people at all points in life, from those in the womb to … adults in need of advocacy and specifically elder care and protecting patients’ rights,” Liberty Pike, communications director at Oregon Right to Life, told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The organization is particularly concerned with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://gov.oregonlive.com/bill/2017/SB494/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; in the state Senate that would change advance directives so patients could refuse spoon-feeding when mentally incompetent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compassion &amp;amp; Choices, too, remains vigilant. The group has weighed in on other issues, like contraception access, that it sees as a question of personal choice in medicine.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also advocate for better communication between patients and their doctors with initiatives like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.compassionandchoices.org/truth-in-treatment/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Truth in Treatment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the more we can detoxify conversations about dying, the better,” Coombs Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
14 million people who have health insurance today won’t have it by the end of the next year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of them will be young, healthy people as well as members of families with low incomes and people over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the conclusion of a report released Monday on the Republican healthcare bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report authors predicted the GOP plan would lead to 14 million more people being uninsured in 2018.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2026, 24 million more people would be uninsured than if the ACA, also known as Obamacare, remained in place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the next decade the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/03/13/520031463/gop-health-care-bill-could-leave-24m-without-coverage-by-2026-cbo-says?sc=17&amp;amp;f=1001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;uninsured rate&lt;/a&gt; would rise from its current 11 percent to 18 percent, wiping out the gains made under the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/hlcmsresource/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/americanhealthcareact_0.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provided fuel for opponents and raised &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/cbo-Republican-obamacare-repeal-plan-236007&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;concerns&lt;/a&gt; among moderate and conservative Republicans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Who would lose insurance?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much of the initial spike in the number of uninsured would result from the repeal of the individual mandate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without the threat of the ACA’s penalties for not having insurance, some people would opt out of buying coverage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others, though, would give up coverage when their premiums increase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And some people would lose coverage when their employer stopped offering insurance to workers. The Republican plan repeals the employer mandate to provide insurance as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large number of uninsured would also result from the plan’s reduced funding of Medicaid, which was expanded under the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2026, 14 million fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid under the Republican bill — accounting for more than half of the increase in uninsured people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This includes people who are eligible now for Medicaid, and those who would have become eligible if more states expanded coverage under the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CBO found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://khn.org/news/deciphering-the-cbo-estimates-on-the-gop-health-bill/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;95 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; who became eligible for Medicaid through the expansion would lose coverage by 2024, as federal funding to states decreases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, 15 percent of people who received healthcare services at Planned Parenthood would “lose access to care.” Most federal funds to Planned Parenthood cover services for people enrolled in the states’ Medicaid program, often people with low incomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the Republican bill would &lt;a href=&quot;http://khn.org/news/Republican-vows-to-defund-planned-parenthood-reality-makes-that-hard/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defund Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; for a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Premiums would eventually fall … for some&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the Republican plan, insurance premiums would rise in 2018 and 2019 as fewer healthy people — those with lower health costs — signed up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Single people in the individual marketplace might see premium increases up to 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Starting in 2020, the repeal of the individual mandate would be offset by other parts of the legislation, and premiums would drop. By 2026, they would be around 10 percent lower than under the ACA, according to the CBO report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, premiums would vary widely by income and age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the Republican bill, insurers would be able to charge older people five times more than they do younger people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, tax credits for older people would only be twice the size of credits for younger people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, the plan would raise premiums “substantially” for older Americans, and lower them “substantially” for younger buyers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, a 64-year-old with an income of $26,500 in 2026 would pay $14,600 a year, compared to $1,700 under Obamacare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a 21-year-old earning $68,200 — 450 percent above the poverty line — in 2026 would pay $1,450 under the Republican bill, compared to $5,100 under the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lower premiums for younger people might encourage more of them to sign up for coverage, something that the ACA had difficulty convincing them to do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Federal deficit would drop&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, the Republican bill would cut the federal deficit by $337 billion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A large part of this would come from an $880 billion decrease in Medicaid spending over the next decade. This amounts to 25 percent less spending for the program by 2026 than projected under the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Repealing ACA subsidies would save $673 billion, although the Republican plan’s tax credits would cost $361 billion, according to the CBO report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Defunding Planned Parenthood for a year would save about $157 million in 2017. But this would also lead to a $21 million increase in Medicaid spending for several thousand pregnancies, as women with low incomes lose access to family planning services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several Republicans have called the CBO’s estimates into question, saying future Republican legislation will affect these numbers. However, those plans have not been released yet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/12/mick-mulvaney/fact-checking-white-house-attack-nonpartisan-cbos-/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Experts&lt;/a&gt; who monitor the CBO say they have found that its predictions are unbiased and “largely sound.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/cancer/031417_breastradiation_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/statistics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;230,815 women&lt;/a&gt; and 2,109 men were diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States and 40,860 women and 464 men died from the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2020, annual breast cancer treatment costs are projected to reach $20 billion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The primary focus of breast cancer care is providing these patients with the best, most effective treatment, said Dr. Rachel A. Greenup, MPH, assistant professor of surgery at the Duke University School Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there is a real need to reduce costs where possible, Greenup adds, as long as care is not compromised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Greenup is the lead author of a study published today in the Journal of Oncology Practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Saving money in breast cancer care&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To investigate whether cost savings could be made in the treatment of breast cancer, Greenup and her team from the Duke Cancer Institute in North Carolina, used data from the National Cancer Database taken in 2011.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In total, the analysis looked at 43,000 breast cancer patients aged 50 or older.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All patients had small tumors that had not spread to the lymph nodes and had undergone a lumpectomy (surgical removal of the cancer without removing the breast).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/shorter-radiation-better-for-early-stage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Earlier research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that this type of patient can do equally well when given a 4-week course of radiation, compared with the standard 6-week course.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another previous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23690420&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; demonstrated that some patients aged 70 or over, who were receiving tamoxifen (a breast cancer drug), did not show any increased survival benefits when also treated with radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, certain breast cancer patients have been shown to do equally well on a reduced course of radiation therapy or no radiation therapy at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite this knowledge, the current study showed that 57 percent of the patients that could have safely reduced (or removed) radiation therapy were still given the full, longer regimens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our study provides an example of a win-win situation, where patients can receive high-quality, evidence-based cancer care while also reducing the treatment burden for patients and the healthcare system,” Greenup said in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using Medicare reimbursement data, the researchers estimated that the cost of the lengthier radiation therapy was more than $13,000 per person, compared with around $8,000 for the shorter radiation regimen. Without any radiation treatment, the cost is zero.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Millions of dollars could be saved&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scaling up the data, the researchers delved into Medicare data for all women with breast cancer over the age of 50 and who were eligible to receive a reduced radiation course.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They concluded that the overall cost of treatment in the U.S. was around $420 million in 2011. If these women had been treated using the alternative approaches that are backed by research, the cost could have been lowered to $256 million, a saving of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/emb_releases/2017-03/dumc-rrc030917.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$164 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Of course, high-quality care is the priority in cancer treatment, but our study suggests that utilization of evidence-based radiation treatment can translate into reductions in healthcare spending without sacrificing quality,” Greenup said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from the reduction in cost, a shorter radiation course would be better for patients, the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The women being treated would not be required to make as many hospital visits, and potentially lose out on work and family time, but they would still receive the best possible care. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study is guaranteed to spark debate. There are, however, shortfalls in the research, as the authors make clear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, Medicare data were used to assess costs, but insurance data would have been more accurate. Those figures were not available to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, the data did not explain why each individual patient subscribed to the longer treatment plan. The 6-week course may have been warranted for reasons not explained in the dataset. Alternatively, the patient may not have felt confident deciding to reduce or omit radiation therapy, making it a personal rather than clinical decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite these shortfalls, the research highlights an area where substantial savings could be made without jeopardizing levels of patient care, Greenup said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It's important to look for opportunities in cancer treatment where we can safely reduce healthcare costs without compromising excellent outcomes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/030317_coldcure_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine if the common cold, something that affects billions of people every year, could be cured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps we are a step closer to that dream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists say they’ve made a breakthrough by analyzing a ribonucleic acid (RNA) genome of the human parechovirus (HPeV), a virus that causes the common cold and polio, along with hand, foot, and mouth disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say the news is promising, but curing the common cold is nothing to sneeze at.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cracking the code&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from the University of York, University of Leeds, and University of Helsinki, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-016-0011-z&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; their findings in the journal Nature Communications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The common cold infects more than two billion people annually, making it one of the most successful viral pathogens, so we are excited to make this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2017/research/scientists-close-in-on-cracking-code-of-common-col/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;crucial step forward&lt;/a&gt;,” Professor Reidun Twarock, a mathematical biologist at the University of York’s Departments of Mathematics and Biology, and the York Centre for Complex Systems Analysis, said in a release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The breakthrough stems from the discovery of a “hidden code” found within HPeV that is responsible for formation of the virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that the code has been found, the research team is trying to figure out what drugs to use to target and destroy it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The coding works like the cogwheels in a Swiss watch,” Professor Peter Stockley from the Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology at the University of Leeds, said in a release. “We now need a drug that has the same effect as pouring sand into the watch. Every part of the viral mechanism could be disabled.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrew Nye, DO, of the Orlando Health Physicians Family Medicine Group, says the research is fascinating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The common cold is actually not just one virus, but a whole host of many different viruses,” he told Healthline. “One of the largest groups is the coronavirus, and there’s a number of different subviruses that belong to that family. So the researchers have identified a structural weak point, if you will, in terms of how all of these viruses package and assemble the shield around themselves. It’s very promising because if a medication could be developed to attack those specific sites, you would ideally be able to attack that whole family of viruses — not just one species, but many different species.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nye said it appears the researchers have identified some valuable targets.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A medication or class of medications that attack these sites would likely be effective for a good amount of time, so that’s pretty exciting,” he said. “The more basic level you can attack a virus on, its basic level of construction, the more success you’re going to have.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Being able to target the cold virus would be brilliant,” Dr. Hilary Hawkins, of the Orlando Health Physician Associates, told Healthline. “I’m not sure if it’s possible because there are so many variants of the cold virus. It’s exciting that they’re looking into this as a possibility, but it’s very early.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A persistent ailment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The common cold certainly lives up to its name. It’s very common.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average adult gets &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/0215/p515.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two to four colds&lt;/a&gt; per year, while children typically get more. It’s the most frequent infectious disease in humans.&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a challenging illness because it presents differently depending on the individual patient, says Hawkins. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not just one discrete thing like strep throat or pneumonia,” she says. “A cold can manifest itself as coughing and sneezing, or congestion, or a sore throat. The duration is different in everybody. It seems to target the immune system differently, to the point where it’s difficult to tease out exactly whether it’s a cold or something else.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The common cold’s diversity is one of the factors that makes it difficult to find a cure. Nye says realistically it’s unlikely that the common cold will ever be fully eradicated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The cold is not just one virus, it’s dozens and dozens of different viruses,” he says. “Even if this medication or class of medications was successful against the host family of coronaviruses, you’re still going to have other viruses that this will not be effective for. And at some point, likely, the coronaviruses will have some mutation that will benefit them to resist this medication or class of medications. Short-term, I think there’s a lot of benefit. In terms of elimination, no, that’s not really realistic, I don’t think, just because these viruses are so pervasive that you have to eliminate them on a global scale pretty much simultaneously, which is not going to happen.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Giving it the cold shoulder&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While everybody catches a cold now and then, there are precautions that can be taken to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hawkins says that washing your hands with soap and water is key, pointing out that the virus lives on surfaces that people are likely to be touching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would say that most people seem to get sick when they travel,” she says. “Part of that is because you’re exposed to a whole new set of germs that you’re normally not exposed to. Also, people don’t realize the nastiness of planes. There have been studies done that show that the places where viruses — the cold virus especially — will stay is the tray tables. Wiping down your tray table, washing your hands before you eat if you can, and turning your body away from someone who’s coughing next to you are all key.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you do catch a cold, it’s important to monitor your symptoms so you can not only get healthy again, but avoid infecting those close to you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hawkins says that anyone who works with children or elderly people should exercise extra caution when it comes to returning to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Certainly, if anyone has a fever, they should not be at work — and they shouldn’t be at work for at least a 24-hour period, until their fever has broken,” says Hawkins. “If you’ve been sick for two or three days, make sure to get rest and get plenty of fluids, but if you can work, you’re not necessarily putting anyone at danger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If we leave it to market forces alone, the new antibiotics we most urgently need are not going to be developed in time,” Marie-Paule Kieny, PhD, WHO's assistant director-general for Health Systems and Innovation, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/bacteria-antibiotics-needed/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts interviewed by Healthline agreed the new drugs are a necessary strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But they said other preventative measures need to be taken because these bacteria are likely to adapt and become resistant to whatever new drugs humans come up with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Drug discovery is just a piece of a very big puzzle,” Dr. Lee Norman, chief medical officer of the University of Kansas Hospital, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The deadly dozen&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;WHO officials divided the dozen deadly bacteria into three categories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the top were three pathogens listed as “critical” dangers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are bacteria that are resistant to multiple drugs. They are a particular threat in hospitals, nursing homes, and with patients who require devices such as ventilators and blood catheters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These hospital-acquired infections are no small matter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates there are more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/hai/surveillance/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;700,000&lt;/a&gt; of these infections every year in acute care hospitals in the United States. About 75,000 people with these infections die during hospitalization every year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Six pathogens were listed on WHO’s second grouping of “high priority” bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The final three pathogens were on a “medium priority” list.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These second and third tiers are comprised of bacteria that are increasingly becoming drug resistant. They are the cause of a number of common diseases such as gonorrhea and salmonella.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“New antibiotics targeting this priority list of pathogens will help to reduce deaths due to resistant infections around the world,” Dr. Evelina Tacconelli, PhD, professor of infectious diseases and head of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Tubingen, said in the press release. “Waiting any longer will cause further public health problems and dramatically impact patient care.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norman told Healthline creating the list is a good way to draw attention to this growing problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s the right step to take,” he said. “It’s a call to action that’s been coming for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, the CDC’s associate director of Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Programs, agrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s helpful to look at data and look at the impact organisms have and then prioritize them,” Srinivasan told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Norman and Srinivasan concur that new drugs are something society just has to develop, even if there is an assumption that bacteria will simply become resistant to new drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among other things, you can’t just stand by and allow someone to suffer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to see people slip away and die,” said Norman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Other steps to take&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Norman and Srinivasan, however, agree that new drugs alone won’t solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bacterium have been on Earth longer than humans and have shown an incredible ability to adapt to their surroundings, they said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We can’t count on drug development to keep us one step ahead,” said Norman. “We need to be humble about this.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both experts say one of the chief ways to reduce the amount of bacterial infections is to make sure hospital rooms and other medical facilities are free of germs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is easier said than done, especially in developing countries, the experts said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norman said new types of catheters and other devices that are less likely to become contaminated need to be invented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added the simple act of people washing their hands frequently and thoroughly could do wonders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We should never fall asleep at the switch on this one,” Norman said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added more research into the causes of bacterial infections could provide other solutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Srinivasan noted that clean water worldwide is another major way to reduce bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need to take care of all the basic infrastructure needs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Srinivasan added that vaccinations are important. Although most vaccines are for viruses, there are a few for bacteria such as certain types of pneumonia and diphtheria. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said regular inoculations are vital, too, because they make people healthier and less likely to succumb to a bacterial infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, the two experts agree that a multipronged approach to drug resistant bacteria is necessary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We have to do all of these things,” said Srinivasan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Most People Don’t Need to Take Omega-3 Supplements</title>

Omega-3 can be found in fish, nuts, oil, and flax seeds, as well as green, leafy vegetables.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of their fundamental role in the good functioning of the human body, omega-3s are believed to have a variety of health benefits, particularly in regards to heart disease. The fats seem to prevent arrhythmias by keeping the heartbeat at a steady pace, lowering the blood pressure, and improving the functioning of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Do omega-3 supplements benefit the population at large and can they be used to prevent heart disease?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To answer this question, the American Heart Association (AHA) reviewed several studies that investigate the benefits of omega-3 dietary supplementation and published a science advisory to report on the findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing committee was chaired by Dr. David Siscovick and the recommendations were &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000482&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the AHA’s journal Circulation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Supplements may not be needed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The advisory group analyzed several randomized controlled trials that assessed the preventive potential of omega-3s on cardiovascular disease, as well as the effect of fish oil supplements on heart attacks, stroke, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and other conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reviewed studies were published since 2002. The advisory also analyzed two studies published before that year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The trials considered for the advisory focused on the use of supplements, but not on omega-3 intake directly from food. They investigated the benefits of taking around 1,000 milligrams of omega-3 daily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The writing committee concluded that treatment with omega-3 supplements is “reasonable” for patients who have experienced a heart attack or heart failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the review did not find sufficient evidence to support the use of omega-3 supplements as a preventive measure against heart disease in the general, healthy population. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We cannot make a recommendation to use omega-3 fish oil supplements for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease at this time,” said Siscovick, senior vice president for research at The New York Academy of Medicine. “People in the general population who are taking omega-3 fish oil supplements are taking them in the absence of scientific data that shows any benefit of the supplements in preventing heart attacks, stroke, heart failure, or death for people who do not have a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Significance of the report&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The advisory’s recommendations are particularly significant given that more than 18 million adults in the United States said that they were taking omega-3 fish oil supplements in 2012, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25671660&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; referenced by the authors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chair of the writing group explained that the new findings confirm previous recommendations made by the AHA in a scientific advisory they published in 2002.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Scientific findings from the past two decades that focused on the prevention of cardiovascular diseases continue to show that among people who are at risk of dying from heart disease, the potential benefit of omega-3 fish oil supplements is still useful for people who have had a recent heart attack, which is consistent with the 2002 statement,&quot; Siscovick said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chair also commented on how the advisory affects healthcare professionals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Physicians should use this advisory as a guide to make decisions on whether omega-3 fish oil supplements might be appropriate for some patients,” Siscovik added. “The advisory concludes that supplementation with omega-3 fish oil may benefit patients with specific, clinical, cardiovascular disease indications, including patients with a recent prior heart attack and heart failure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

ah Patterson was sexually assaulted as a sophomore in high school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But she never really received the treatment she needed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My doctor didn’t know how to talk to a scared teen,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patterson isn’t the only young girl to have faced a similar experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teens and young adults over the age of 12 experience the highest rate of sexual assault, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/139/3/e20164243&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; published in the March 2017 issue of Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Up to now, teen girls and women haven’t always received the care they’ve needed, or even been properly identified as victims of assault.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) wants to change that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aappublications.org/news/2017/02/27/assault022717&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New guidelines&lt;/a&gt; recently released by the AAP reflect a growing effort to identify and help teens like Patterson as early as possible. Those guidelines include encouraging physicians to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Routinely ask adolescents about any history of sexual violence, dating violence, and sexual assaults. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Screen for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offer emergency contraception to female adolescents who disclose sexual assault if reported within 120 hours of the assault.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be prepared to offer emotional support and referrals for additional counseling. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The goal is to help teens open up to their physicians and to ensure they get the support they need if an assault has taken place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Debate over guidelines&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, not everyone is on board with the changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some parents don’t feel comfortable with doctors talking to their teens about these subjects, and some past victims of abuse feel as though these new guidelines wouldn’t help anyway. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I know I wouldn’t have said anything if I’d been asked as a teen.” Chris B. of California told Healthline. “My abuser always threatened to kill my mother if I told. So I never did.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea Duncan of Missouri agreed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think most teens would talk. I know I never would have talked in front of a parent,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a teen hasn’t already opened up to a parent, what are the chances they will open up to a doctor when their parent is present?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of these new guidelines, should doctors be requesting a few minutes alone with teen patients to ask these potentially uncomfortable questions? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robyn Boring, the mother of daughters, was adamant in her response.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Given the stories I know of pediatricians and doctors who have been complicit in child abuse and trafficking of pictures and persons, I would absolutely not allow a doctor to be alone with my daughters or son questioning them,” Boring told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Possible solutions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what is the answer?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How can doctors help their patients to open up, and how can they better provide the support those patients might need?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jody Jordan, a family advocate in Texas, told Healthline she’s in favor of these new guidelines, believing they are a step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In my profession,” she explained, “we are encouraged [and required] to watch for signs of abuse. Stats vary, but most studies say that at least 1 in 5 girls and 1 in 20 boys will be sexually abused in childhood. And screening for that, in my opinion, is a good thing. These questions should be getting asked. And I would hope parents would look at this as another level of protection for the most vulnerable members of our society.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heather Pickens, a mother in Arizona, agrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She told Healthline the story of a friend who was sexually abused as a young teen. That friend spoke to a D.A.R.E. officer in their middle school, which was what started the process of getting her the help she needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In her case,” Pickens said, “she finally met an authority figure that she could trust and felt comfortable telling the truth to. So for me, I feel like more pediatricians and family doctors performing these screenings might help to make more teens feel comfortable opening up. It’s just one more potential authority figure who could make that connection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In reality, Planned Parenthood officials, say it is not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The White House proposal that Planned Parenthood stop providing abortion is the same demand opponents of women’s health have been pushing for decades, as a part of their long-standing effort to end women’s access to safe, legal abortion,” Erica Sackin, the director of political communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, told Healthline in an email. “Planned Parenthood has always stood strong against these attacks on our patients and their ability to access the full range of reproductive healthcare.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abortion opponents see the rejection as the organization revealing its true priorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It helps to show how central abortion is to Planned Parenthood’s operations,” Eric Scheidler, executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The debate has galvanized both sides, with supporters of Planned Parenthood rallying to their cause.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All women need Planned Parenthood reproductive health services,” Terry O’Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;It’s Medicaid money&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what is the $500 million at stake here?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not a line item in the federal budget that is simply crossed out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of that money comes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/health-care-equity/medicaid-and-reproductive-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medicaid&lt;/a&gt; when Planned Parenthood is reimbursed by that federal program for services provided for people receiving Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other money comes from reimbursements under &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/health-care-equity/title-x/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Title X&lt;/a&gt;, a federal family planning program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The defunding proposal is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/affordable-care-act-obamacare-health.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Republicans’ plan&lt;/a&gt;, unveiled a week ago, to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It would take away those federal reimbursements for Planned Parenthood for one year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medicaid is &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-defunding-planned-parenthood-could-affect-health-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;funded jointly&lt;/a&gt; by the federal government and the states. Those states could decide to make up the difference.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, several states had already begun processes to defund Planned Parenthood, even before Donald Trump took over the White House.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Texas, legislators took action in December to take away Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. That prohibition was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/22/516631590/judge-rules-texas-cant-cut-off-medicaid-funds-to-planned-parenthood-for-now&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;temporarily halted&lt;/a&gt; last month by a federal judge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Iowa, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/02/amid-heated-rhetoric-iowa-senate-votes-halt-planned-parenthood-funding/97378012/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;state senators voted&lt;/a&gt; in early February to block Planned Parenthood from receiving federal funds. That bill is now making its way through the Iowa House.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Mississippi, a federal judge last October &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mississippi-plannedparenthood-idUSKCN12L0EB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;struck down&lt;/a&gt; a state law that would have barred medical providers that perform abortions from participating in the state’s Medicaid program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Planned Parenthood supporters point out that federal law prohibits federal money from being used for abortion services. They say the reimbursements go for other health programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents, like Scheidler, say the federal funds free up money for Planned Parenthood to provide those other services, so the reimbursements indirectly pay for abortions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say it’s time for the federal government to put an end to this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If Planned Parenthood gets out of the abortion business, it will be a net gain for America,” said Scheidler.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supporters of the organization see across-the-board disaster if that happens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Defunding Planned Parenthood would block millions of people in this country from accessing birth control, cancer screenings, and preventive care,” said Sackin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What would be the effect?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Planned Parenthood, about three-fourths of the organization’s patients have incomes at or below 150 percent of the poverty level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/blog/how-federal-funding-works-at-planned-parenthood&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;60 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the organization’s patients receive services for free through Medicaid or Title X, a federal family planning program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If Planned Parenthood didn’t receive those federal reimbursements, that would mean it would either have to deny services to people with low incomes, or perform those services for free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Either way, supporters say, the defunding would force the organization to close some of its 650 clinics across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For many patients, Planned Parenthood is the only healthcare provider they see,” said Sackin. “Blocking access to care at Planned Parenthood hurts communities that are struggling to get by the most, especially those with low incomes, those living in areas with no other quality health care providers, and communities of color who face systemic barriers to care.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scheidler said Planned Parenthood’s position is “a form of extortion” because they are telling federal officials they will yank all services if they can’t perform abortions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sackin did not respond to Scheidler’s claim, but O’Neill did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said that organizations like Pro-Life Action League have engaged in their own form of extortion by threatening women seeking abortions as well as the facilities where they’re performed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added that wanting to provide a full range of services is not extortion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If Planned Parenthood clinics did close, abortion opponents say women could find those health services at other facilities that receive federal funding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The goal is to preserve the health services that women get,” said Scheidler.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Planned Parenthood supporters say it’s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say some women trust only Planned Parenthood to provide them with health services. This is especially true of teenage girls who might not want their parents to know they went to the doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, in many underserved communities, Planned Parenthood is the only facility near enough for women to visit. This is particularly true in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In a lot of these communities, women use Planned Parenthood as their primary care physician,” said O’Neill. “Places like rural areas would be badly hurt.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even Scheidler admits the adjustment would take time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It might take some effort to make up that gap,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There has been a preview of sorts of this ripple effect in Texas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, state lawmakers introduced a series of budget cuts for family planning services. Those reductions caused the closure of 82 clinics, one-third of which were affiliated with Planned Parenthood, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1511902#t=article&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the New England Journal of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Planned Parenthood supporters say this magnitude of closures would drastically reduce health services to women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They note the birth control and family planning services they provide actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/health-care-equity/medicaid-and-reproductive-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;save taxpayers money.&lt;/a&gt; They say their programs help prevent 2 million unintended pregnancies a year. Overall, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/planned-parenthood-at-a-glance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;those programs&lt;/a&gt; along with cancer screenings and other services save taxpayers more than $13 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therefore, they say, opponents should accept the fact Planned Parenthood performs abortions because of all the other services that it provides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scheidler can’t agree to that compromise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I can’t accept that bargain,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Planned Parenthood officials say it’s a matter of weighing the benefits their organization provides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For the vast majority of people in this country, Planned Parenthood is the solution, not the problem,” said Sackin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/031317_fainting_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fainting could be a sign of a serious heart problem and should be evaluated by a doctor, say new guidelines from three leading heart organizations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://circ.ahajournals.org/lookup/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000498&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, issued Thursday by the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association and Heart Rhythm Society, are the first such guidelines on the topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fainting is fairly common. About 41 percent of Americans have fainted at some point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is very important because fainting impacts thousands of people every day,” said Dr. Win-Kuang Shen, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix and chair of the group that developed the guidelines. “Having these guidelines is not only good for the clinicians using them, but for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What causes fainting?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When someone faints, they lose consciousness due to a drop in blood pressure, resulting in a lack of oxygen to the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Fainting can be due to neurological, psychological or cardiac causes,” said Dr. Gerald Fletcher, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, who was not involved in writing the new guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Occasional fainting is not necessarily cause for concern, but if it’s repetitive, it needs to be addressed, he said. About 14 percent of people have recurrent fainting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Extreme emotion, such as attending a funeral or in response to seeing blood, can trigger fainting, but it is not life-threatening, said Dr. Vincent Bufalino, M.D., a cardiologist and president of Advocate Medical Group in Naperville, Illinois, who was not involved in writing the new guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart-related causes are to blame for fainting more often in people over 60 compared to younger people, according to the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could be due to underlying heart disease or taking a higher dose of blood pressure-lowering medication, Bufalino said. Dehydration at any age can also contribute to fainting, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Irregular heart rhythms and faulty heart valves are the most common heart triggers for fainting, Bufalino said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to do after fainting&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new guidelines say people who faint for any reason should get a physical exam and provide their doctor with a detailed medical history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The office visit may include an electrocardiogram, a simple, inexpensive test of the heart’s electrical activity that can help spot heart-related causes of fainting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Competitive athletes who faint should see a doctor before resuming sports, the guidelines say. Bufalino said athletes typically pass out from dehydration or overexertion, but testing can help identify or rule out hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an enlarged heart that could require additional treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most people who faint, additional tests, such as MRI or CT scans, are unnecessary unless the person has already been diagnosed with heart disease or a new heart issue is suspected, according to the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doing appropriate tests when needed and not “spending a fortune” on unnecessary tests is the best approach to fainting from a cardiovascular point of view, Fletcher said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although it’s important to remember that most fainting episodes are not severe, Fletcher said, checking in with your doctor to ask if it’s something to worry about is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/first-fainting-guidelines-issued-to-diagnose-life-threatening-heart-conditions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;original story&lt;/a&gt; was published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Heart Association News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

But if you deliberately do it, then you can really reverse most it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specifically, interval training — brief bursts of high-intensity cardio followed by longer period of lighter activity or rest — led to a 49 percent increase in mitochondrial capacity in the muscle cells of volunteers ages 18 to 30.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also produced a 69 percent increase in participants ages 65 to 80.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those were the two age groups included in the research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study divided volunteers — 36 men and 36 women — into a group that did high-intensity interval cycling, one that lifted weights, and another that did both. Researchers then took biopsies from the participants’ thigh muscles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The benefits went beyond interval training causing mitochondrial improvements.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The quicker, more intense exercises also reduced insulin sensitivity and, thus, susceptibility to diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nair said the study was intended to help uncover how exercise affects cell functioning, not necessarily to find the best exercises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he would recommend combining HIIT with strength training to maximize both the age-reversing cellular benefits and the muscle strength improvement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said to stick with the interval training if you only have time for one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Broader benefits&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The broader benefits to health and longevity from exercise have been well established for more than 70 years, said Jennifer Turgiss, Ph.D., vice president of behavioral science and advanced analytics at Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson Health and Wellness Solutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She rattles off a list of ailments that exercise is known to decrease the likelihood of developing. These include stroke, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancers, depression, and anxiety. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, she says, through new research methods we are starting to learn more about how physical activity affects us at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is early days for this type of research, so there would be no changes in [exercise] recommendations yet,” Turgiss told Healthline. “But keep on the watch.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She notes that updates to the government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.gov/paguidelines/second-edition/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; are currently in the works. Those &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.gov/paguidelines/guidelines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; don’t currently mention cellular health or interval training.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most athletes already use &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/what-exercises-are-best&quot;&gt;interval training&lt;/a&gt; in their exercise programs and the approach appears to be growing in popularity among non-athletes as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some ideas on how to apply it in your own exercise routines, look to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0154075&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; last year that put 27 sedentary men through 12 weeks of HIIT consisting of three 20-second sprints on a stationary bike, each followed by 2 minutes of easier riding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group, which biked for 10 minutes a day total, saw the same benefits in terms of aerobic fitness, regulation of blood sugar, and improved function of muscle cells as men who biked for 45 minutes at 70 percent of their maximal heart rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
Life with a progressive disease can be challenging for anyone, even the most prepared. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not knowing what the future holds can make for unnecessary stress. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add to that a lack of approved therapies, and someone with the disease could lose hope. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But doctors and researchers, in a range of studies, are beginning to find answers to these issues for people with progressive multiple sclerosis (MS). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Understanding who will develop progression with the disease is a big part of MS treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stopping the progression is key to slowing or stopping neurological damage, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002639/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;early treatment&lt;/a&gt; leads to a better chance of living well with MS.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there are no drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for progressive MS, one medication is expected to get FDA approval late this month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/new-multiple-sclerosis-drug-awaits-approval&quot;&gt;Ocrelizumab&lt;/a&gt; is considered a breakthrough in the treatment of progressive MS. Study participants showed lower rates of clinical progression — meaning their symptoms appeared improved after receiving the drug. Also, the number of lesions showing up on MRI were fewer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Predicting MS&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170301224233.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, researchers report they found a way for early diagnosis of MS in the progressive category. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a group of 155 people ages 50 and older, 30 percent progressed to secondary progressive MS by the five-year mark of the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two things in common with all those who progressed? Fatigue and weak or spasmodic legs.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Study participants with those symptoms were more likely to progress from relapsing-remitting MS to secondary progressive MS within five years,” said study author Dr. &lt;a href=&quot;http://medicine.buffalo.edu/content/medicine/faculty/profile.html?ubit=bw8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bianca Weinstock-Guttman&lt;/a&gt;, of the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Buffalo in New York, and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. “Better understanding who is at high risk of getting worse may eventually allow us to tailor more specific treatments to these people.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both fatigue and leg issues can be common for people with MS. Excessive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Fatigue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; is considered the most disabling symptom. It occurs in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Symptoms-Diagnosis/MS-Symptoms/Fatigue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;80 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people with MS, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, fatigue can lead to &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1352458517695470&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exacerbated symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as poor cognitive function. Cog-fog, as it is often called, causes issues with information processing speed, attention, motor function, and memory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are not a lot of effective treatments for fatigue, especially without strong side effects. However, researchers are not giving up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a recent study, researchers looked at the efficacy of a personalized &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24854634&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neuromodulation&lt;/a&gt; treatment, basically a form of &lt;a href=&quot;/health/electroconvulsive-therapy&quot;&gt;electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)&lt;/a&gt;. The study suggested that interventions could help relieve debilitating symptoms by targeting key areas of the brain.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, “[Fatigue] can significantly interfere with a person’s ability to function at home and work, and is one of the primary causes of early departure from the workforce.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Seeking the cause&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the industry has seen many improvements for relapsing MS there have been little for those with progressive MS. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is changing as doctors and researchers find success in their studies of progression, what causes it, and how to stop it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Along with fatigue and spasmodic legs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12035-015-9648-6&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;biomarkers&lt;/a&gt; continue to be tested for use in understanding progression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cause of progression is not known, but recent studies continue to unveil interesting conclusions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;North Africans in France progressed significantly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/431042&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;faster&lt;/a&gt; than Caucasian people with MS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Ireland, the typical &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9576534&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;person with MS&lt;/a&gt; is age 54 and older. There was a preponderance of men and a greater number of people with motor onset compared with other subgroups of people with MS. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The increasing number of successful studies looking into progressive MS is hopeful, experts say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While more research needs to be done, this study brings us closer to understanding which older adults with MS may be at higher risk of getting worse,” said Weinstock-Guttman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

<title>What? Hearing Loss Expected to Rise Dramatically</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/031017_hearingloss_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you fear you’re going to spend your “golden years” with a hand cupped behind your ear, saying “Eh, what?” you may not be all that wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And some younger people may be joining you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaotolaryngology/article-abstract/2606784&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, the number of adults in the United States 20 years of age or older with hearing loss is expected to nearly double in coming decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Put another way, that means the percentage of adults who have hearing loss will rise from 15 percent to 22 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a jump from 44 million in 2020 to 73 million in 2060. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Demand for hearing services&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adele Goman, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and Health in Maryland, is one of several scientists who analyzed audiometric data from the latest National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s a biannual epidemiologic survey of a representative sample of the U.S. noninstitutionalized population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Last year we estimated how common hearing loss is across different age groups and how many adults have hearing loss today,” Goman told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and by the Eleanor Schwartz Charitable Foundation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We did not know the number of adults that are expected to have hearing loss in the coming decades,” Goman said. “This is important to know in order to appropriately plan for future hearing healthcare needs.”&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the number of adults with hearing loss is expected to increase in the coming years, demand for audiologic services will increase as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than two-thirds of adults 70 years or older in the United States will have clinically meaningful hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Audiologic healthcare services encompass a range of options including aural rehabilitation, hearing aid fitting, hearing screenings and referrals, hearing aid testing, and novel approaches to hearing healthcare,” said Goman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A public health issue&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study concludes that hearing loss is a major public health issue independently associated with higher healthcare costs, accelerated cognitive decline, and poorer physical functioning. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s not any surprise to Barbara Kelley, whose position as executive director of the Hearing Loss Association of America puts her on the front lines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve always known hearing loss is a primary health concern,” Kelley told Healthline. “When you have one health problem, you probably have others.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She noted that people with hearing loss have more falls than those not affected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There may be a link to dementia as well,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is thought that some aspects of hearing loss are due to aging, she said. “But we don’t know if that’s due to exposure to too much noise. It may be a co-morbidity factor.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember all those warnings about loud rock music that went in one ear and out the other, so to speak?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you leave a concert with ringing in your ears, for example, that’s a sign that some cells in your ear have died, Kelley said. And they stay dead forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Changes are afoot&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, a hearing aid might cost $4,000 and it’s not covered by most insurance carriers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kelley said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suggested a new category of over-the-counter devices. It would be a first step into amplification devices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One new device uses “smart buds” controlled by your smart phone. Kelly said the high-tech format might be popular with aging baby boomers who say, “I don’t need a hearing aid. That’s for old people.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The hearing aid market has a low volume, high cost model,” Kelley said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that could change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kelley cited a bill introduced in November by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D.-Mass.) and Chuck Grassley (R.-Iowa), the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act of 2016.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bipartisan legislation would make certain types of hearing aids available without prescription as well as remove some of the requirements that make it difficult for consumers to get the products they need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’d love to see Medicare cover hearing loss,” Kelley said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Medicare was established in 1965 its intent was to focus on life-threatening issues. Hearing loss, vision, and dental care were specifically excluded and it would take an act of Congress to reverse that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s a hard nut to crack,” Kelley admitted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also in the works: On Apr. 18, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will host a daylong workshop to examine competition, innovation, and consumer protection issues raised by hearing health and technology, especially hearing aids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health and science authorities observe that many more consumers could benefit from hearing healthcare devices and related services, but cannot afford them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://nationalacademies.org/hmd/reports/2016/Hearing-Health-Care-for-Adults.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016 report&lt;/a&gt; by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine estimates that “67 to 86 percent of adults who may benefit from hearing aids do not use them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/01/ftc-announces-workshop-hearing-health-technology&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FTC workshop&lt;/a&gt; will bring together researchers, healthcare providers, industry representatives, consumer representatives, policymakers, and others to examine ways in which enhanced competition and innovation might increase the availability and adoption of hearing aids by those consumers who need them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The workshop will be free and open to the public. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So listen up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Low-Gluten Diet May Be Linked to Diabetes Risk</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/Diabetes/0309i17_glutendiabetes_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does a diet low in gluten increase the risk of type 2 diabetes?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers involved in a new, long-term study think it might, but some dietitians argue the link could actually be due to a low intake of fiber. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the observational study commencing in 1984, researchers estimated the daily gluten intake for almost 200,000 participants through food questionnaires completed every two to four years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings were &lt;a href=&quot;http://professional.heart.org/professional/EducationMeetings/MeetingsLiveCME/EPILifestyle/UCM_316904_EPI-Lifestyle-Scientific-Sessions.jsp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;presented today&lt;/a&gt; at the American Heart Association's Epidemiology and Prevention / Lifestyle and Cardiometabolic Health 2017 Scientific Sessions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What researchers discovered&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their study, researchers found that those who ate the most gluten had a lower risk for developing type 2 diabetes in the 30 years of follow-up study. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Participants in the highest 20 percent of gluten consumption had a 13 percent lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with those with the lowest daily gluten consumption (fewer than 4 grams).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We wanted to determine if gluten consumption will affect health in people with no apparent medical reasons to avoid gluten,” Geng Zong, PhD, a research fellow in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Gluten-free foods often have less dietary fiber and other micronutrients, making them less nutritious, and they also tend to cost more. People without celiac disease may reconsider limiting their gluten intake for chronic disease prevention, especially for diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Janelle Smith, MS, dietitian for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://celiac.org/&quot;&gt;Celiac Disease Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, says those who are forced to be gluten-free due to celiac disease shouldn’t be concerned by the study. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Those with celiac disease might worry that they are at an increased risk of type 2 diabetes based on these results. As of now, research does not show that celiac disease is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, but it is associated with type 1 diabetes,” she told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is quite possible that it is not reduced gluten, but overall reduced fiber intake that would result in this correlation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The fiber connection&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith is not alone in suggesting a possible link between type 2 diabetes and a low-gluten diet could in fact be due to restricted fiber intake. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.susanweinernutrition.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Susan Weiner&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and nutritionist, holds a similar view on the research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My initial thought is that people who restricted gluten [also] restricted fiber from whole grains as well in their quest to limit their gluten intake,” Weiner told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Additionally, if they ate cake, crackers, and cookies which were gluten free without looking at carbohydrates or calories, that could have caused an increase in weight associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The cause is not conclusive, but this seems likely.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of those who participated in the study, individuals who ate less gluten also tended to eat less cereal fiber, which is considered a protective factor against the development of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weiner says it is important those who follow a gluten-free diet ensure they are not eating too much processed food. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When folks go ‘gluten free’ for reasons other than a legitimate reason such as celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, they often purchase processed gluten-free foods such as cookies, crackers, and chips. These foods have low nutritional value, pack on calories, and are low in fiber,” she told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The health consequences of following a gluten-free diet composed primarily of processed foods can lead to weight gain and detrimental long-term consequences associated with low fiber intake,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Low-gluten diet popularity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gluten is a type of protein found in wheat and rye that gives bread and baked goods elasticity and a chewy texture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only a small percentage of the population cannot eat gluten. About &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3264942/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1 percent&lt;/a&gt; must abstain due to celiac disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite a lack of evidence that reducing consumption of gluten provides long-term health benefits, gluten-free diets have been gaining popularity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say this isn’t necessarily a good thing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The rise of popularity of the gluten-free diet is a double-edged sword for people with a medical necessity for it,” Alice Bast, chief executive officer of the patient advocacy group &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.beyondceliac.org/celiac-disease/facts-and-figures/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Beyond Celiac&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The gluten-free fad has driven the increase in the availability of packaged food options and to some extent raised awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity,” she added. “However, we’ve also seen the gluten-free fad overshadow the fact that it’s the only current treatment for celiac disease … For those of us for whom the gluten-free diet is not an option, it has resulted in our not being taken seriously in situations in which we don’t have 100 percent control over our food and beverages.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smith says the findings of the research may prompt those who abstain from gluten for reasons other than celiac disease and sensitivities to think carefully about doing so. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I hope that the public will begin to realize that ‘gluten-free’ does not equate with ‘healthy,’ and that a healthy gluten-free diet takes planning and consideration,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Its prevalence increases from 22 percent around the age of 40 to almost 50 percent by the age of 70.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.6px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;The most commonly prescribed form of ED medication is the so-called phosphodiesterase type 5 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://livertox.nih.gov/PDE5Inhibitors.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PDE5&lt;/a&gt;) inhibitors, which cause vasodilation in the penis and lungs. On the market, they are sold as Viagra, Levitra, Cialis, and Stendra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;New research&amp;nbsp; - presented today at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://accscientificsession.acc.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session&lt;/a&gt; - examines the effect of PDE5 inhibitors on men who have had a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;For men, the risk of heart disease rises considerably after the age of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/hdw/atrisk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What researchers learned&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;The team - led by Dr. Daniel Peter Andersson, a postdoctoral researcher at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden - looked at the health records of men aged 80 and under who had been diagnosed and hospitalized with their first heart attack between 2007 and 2013.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;The health records were part of a Swedish national database that included every hospital in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;The patients were followed for an average period of 3.3 years after their initial heart attack. Researchers compared the health outcomes of those who received a prescription for a PDE5 inhibitor or alprostadil - another kind of ED medication that is not a PDE5 inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;Overall, slightly more than 7 percent of men received a prescription for an ED drug. Of these, 92 percent were prescribed a PDE5 inhibitor and 8 percent obtained a prescription for alprostadil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;After adjusting for risk factors such as diabetes, stroke, and heart failure, the researchers found that men who were prescribed PDE5 inhibitors or alprostadil were 40 percent less likely to be hospitalized for heart failure than men who were not using ED medication.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.6px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;Additionally, it appeared that taking PDE5 inhibitors also decreased the mortality risk for patients with a heart attack diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;The findings indicated a dose-response trend - as more prescriptions for PDE5 inhibitors correlated with a lower risk of premature death - but the authors caution that the study is too small to categorically indicate a dose-response benefit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;ED medication and heart attacks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;The lead author said the findings are significant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;&quot;If you have an active sex life after a heart attack, it is probably safe to use PDE5 inhibitors,” said Andersson in a statement. “This type of erectile dysfunction treatment is beneficial in terms of prognosis, and having an active sex life seems to be a marker for a decreased risk of death [and] a healthy lifestyle, especially in the oldest quartile - those 70 to 80 years old. From the perspective of a doctor, if a patient asks about erectile dysfunction drugs after a heart attack and has no contraindications for PDE5 inhibitors, based on these results you can feel safe about prescribing it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;As the study is observational, the researchers could not establish causality or uncover the mechanism by which ED medication may improve cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;Therefore, Andersson says, it is possible that ED drugs are a marker of an active sex life, which could be the reason why these patients went on to live a healthy, heart disease-free life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;However, the authors note that PDE5 inhibitors were initially designed to treat &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HeartAttack/DiagnosingaHeartAttack/Angina-Chest-Pain_UCM_450308_Article.jsp#.WMFGohLyhR0&quot;&gt;angina&lt;/a&gt; - a type of chest pain that occurs when the heart does not receive enough oxygen-filled blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;Andersson and team also point out that previous research has linked PDE5 inhibitors with lower blood pressure in the heart’s left ventricle. This makes it easier for the heart to pump blood, and the authors speculate that this could explain why the ED medication is beneficial for people who have had a heart attack.&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.6px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;Despite this, Andersson deems the results of his research surprising, as ED is normally associated with a higher risk of heart disease in healthy men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;Finally, the authors acknowledge the limitations of their study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;The participants’ socioeconomic status was not accounted for and the research did not consider the impact of untreated ED - or the effect of having a healthy, active, medication-free sex life - on people who had had a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;Normal1&quot;&gt;In the future, Andersson and colleagues plan to conduct a larger-scale study that includes more health records and more comprehensive data on the participants’ education, marital status, and level of income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoda Kotb of the “Today Show” adopted a child at age 52.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Actor George Clooney is anticipating fatherhood for the first time at age 55.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Celebrities may get the headlines, but they aren’t the only ones embracing parenthood at an older age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_12.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Vital Statistics Report&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more women over age 40 are having children, with a 2 percent increase in births by women 40 to 44 during 2014. Women over 50 also had more babies in 2014 than 2013.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Illinois residents Maura Collins and her husband, Todd Beidler, were 40 and 43 when they had their first child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We got married later in life, so starting a family in our 40s is just the way things went for us,” Collins told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet the couple does consider how their age could present challenges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We both recognize that we are always going to be among the older parents at our children’s games or school events, but we’re very cognizant of staying healthy as much as we can control so we can keep up with the kids and enjoy them physically as much as possible,” said Collins. “My husband has done the math and when our youngest child graduates college, he’ll be 67. While that’s a little scary to think about since with age comes physical and health concerns, the math wasn’t going to prevent us from having children.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So was the case for California residents Matt and Jenny, who adopted their first child when they were 53 years old and their second child when they were 54.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After trying to conceive naturally and through IVF for nearly 12 years, they decided to adopt through the Los Angeles County foster care system. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Another couple we knew were going down that path. Their story inspired us,” Matt told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The couple, who didn’t want their full names revealed, fostered two children who ultimately were reunified with their biological parents. However, the next two children they fostered were placed with them permanently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Older parents and adoption&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adoptive parents like the Matt and Jenny are not uncommon, says Megan Lestino, vice president of public policy and education at the National Council for Adoption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Older adults come to adoption through different routes. Sometimes they come to us through infertility and other times they have older children in the home and realize they have the time and finances to raise another child,” Lestino told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She notes that while not always the case, adoptive parents tend to be older. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the United States does not have a federal regulation regarding a maximum age at which a parent can adopt, Lestino says it’s up to the states to determine the age of parents for both infant and foster adoption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many states will require parents to be at least 18 to 21 years old and a certain amount of years older than the child they’re adopting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Typically there’s no age limit on the other end,” Lestino says. “As long as parents are capable of parenting the child they’re being matched with, in most cases there aren’t rules around age. Adoption professionals can see that with age comes a certain level of resilience, responsibility, and experience that can be beneficial to parenting. As long as they’re physically capable of caring for the needs of a child, age is neutral.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt and Jenny can attest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When they were screened by a private adoption agency, “they were more concerned with how stable we were as individuals and as a couple, what our motivations were to foster and eventually adopt. We were required to do health screenings and background checks. Point being, our age was not an issue,” said Matt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the couple thinks about how they’ll be in their 70s when their children are in their 20s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I also considered, perhaps a little cynically, that our chances of being alive when our children are graduating college are at least as good or maybe better than that of bio-parents half our age who are hard drug users,” notes Matt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to open adoption, in which the birth parents choose adoptive parents for their child, age may be more of an issue, explains Lestino.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some birth parents may consider health and age while others may see age as experience, so it depends on their preferences. In most cases, age is a consideration birth parents are aware of, but it’s more about what comes with age than age itself,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Greg Eubanks, president and chief executive officer of the World Association for Children and Parents (WACAP), agrees with Lestino’s sentiment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, he says many adoption agencies have policies about age. For instance, WACAP requires that there is at most a 48-year difference between a child’s age and the youngest parent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The main reason is that children from adoption have faced all kinds of losses so we want to set them up with the best family as possible. If we see a family who is well into their 50s, we do need to consider issues regarding health, ability to parent, and where the parents will be when the child is nearing the teenage years and becoming more active,” Eubanks told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He adds that older parents make ideal parents for older children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Parents who are older tend to have more patience, they have more life experience, and are more tolerant. These are all great qualities for older children. And with older children, older parents may not have to deal with the exhaustion that comes with say, a toddler,” Eubanks said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For older parents who want to adopt from a country outside of the United States, age may or may not become a barrier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each country sets their own age requirements with some countries setting strict maximum age limits and others having more flexible standards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, in China, adoptive parents have to be at least 30, and married couples over 50 years of age can adopt, but the age difference between the child and younger spouse can’t be more than 50 years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Parenting through surrogacy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adoption seemed far-fetched for Sparky Campanella, a 56-year-old man in California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I considered it, but found it impossible for a single man to adopt a baby. I could find places that would allow me to adopt 2 years and up, but I wanted those two years since they are important in terms of a child’s development,” Campanella told Healthline. “Plus, the genetic tie initially wasn’t that important to me, but I found it more important as I went through the process.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the death of his father five years ago, Campanella says the desire to become a parent became strong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My mom had died before that, and at some point after my dad’s death, being at the end of the line and seeing the importance of family at the end of life, something changed in me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Campanella was married in his early 30s, but neither he nor his ex-wife seriously considered a family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We were into our careers and we thought maybe someday, but things didn’t work out. Then we got divorced,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Campanella dated women with children over the years, he says he often felt like a third wheel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 53 years old, he began looking into egg donors and surrogate mothers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I found my egg donors profile it all crystalized. I saw someone who actually reminded me of my ex-wife in terms of looks and intelligence and background,” Campanella says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He chose the egg donor and found a surrogate. In 2015, his son, Rhys, was born. Campanella was 54.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In terms of my age being a limitation on me being a good father, I don’t think it is. I’m good in health and have a lot of energy,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Challenges, benefits of older parents&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Campanella, Collins, Matt, and Jenny all agree that staying healthy is a concern for them, and therefore they take extra care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also agree that the physical demands of being an older parent can take a toll.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, Susan Bartell, PhD, a New York-based psychologist and author who specializes in parenting, says many older parents she sees are tired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s tough to take care of a baby when your body and brain aren’t quite prepared for the job,” Bartell told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt says he and his wife wake up most mornings sore.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I joke that despite playing football and having bad skiing accidents when I was younger, I was never as sore as I am now,” he said. “Nothing that some ibuprofen and hugs from the little ones won’t fix.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Collins admits that it would be physically easier to raise children if she were 10 years younger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the sleep deprivation would be easier if we were younger since we’d probably bounce back easier,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Campanella adds that parenting never ends.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is relentless and there’s a mental and physical exhaustion to it, but there’s also an amazing experience and a privilege that I wouldn’t give up,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to how other, younger parents of their children’s peers might view them, none of the parents are concerned.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our perception is that families are becoming more and more diverse. Also, we see that starting a family in the ‘traditional’ way isn’t necessarily a guarantee of a happy, stable family. If it were, there wouldn’t be such a dire need for foster parents,” said Matt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Collins agrees and believes she can relate to younger parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I can still hold a conversation with younger parents, and I do see some older parents of my generation, so it’s not a massive divide,” she said. “Today, kids are open minded to different types of families. Most importantly, they love you unconditionally, so being there for them and as present as possible is what’s most important.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Campanella sought out new friends once becoming a parent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Making friends with single moms really helped. We are in the same situation. Especially since the only family and support I have left is my brother who lives out East,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bartell notes that older parents like Campanella often face the challenge of finding support outside of family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The new parents’ parents are much older, so there is likely less support from grandparents,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being more established in their career and financially stable has allowed Campanella and Collins the opportunity to pay for support through childcare as well as the ability to work from home part-time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though Bartell says that’s not always the case.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“[Older parents] are more entrenched in a career and lifestyle and so it is more difficult to be as flexible in parenting as it often requires. This is stressful for new parents,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finding balance with work, a social life, and personal time is a challenge for any parent, argues Matt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’d expect you would hear that from parents in their 20s,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Biggest benefit of being older&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life experience is the greatest benefit of being an older parent, according to Campanella, Collins, and Matt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I spent a lot of time on myself, therapists, workshops, journaling, and life experiences, so I do feel that maturity and perspective helps me parent,” Campanella said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Collins says she lived a fulfilling life during her 20s and 30s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have no regrets socially or professionally. I don’t look back and wish I could do more now, and I can share all those experiences with the kids,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matt believes he and his wife are better parents today than they could have been in their younger days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We have a lot to offer our girls in terms of life experience, values, creativity,” he said. “As I’ve gotten older, I’ve finally realized that the world doesn’t revolve around me, and that everything I do, say, or even think has some impact on the world. I think those are good things to pass on to children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
nday, Republican leadership in the House of Representatives moved forward with &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2017/03/07/examining-the-house-republican-aca-repeal-and-replace-legislation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;two bills&lt;/a&gt; to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act (ACA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bills, though, are far from a full repeal, which may mean Republicans recognize that the ACA wasn’t all bad.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are so many things about the ACA that did work well,” Kurt Mosley, vice president of strategic alliances at Merritt Hawkins, Staff Care, told Healthline. “And it’s a lot cheaper to remodel a house than it is to tear it down and rebuild it back up again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main effects of the legislation are on the ACA provisions for making health insurance more affordable as well as individual and employer mandates, taxes, and reforms to Medicaid. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The legislation would also defund &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/planned-parenthood.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt; for a year, and cut funding for vaccine research and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/7/14842090/republican-health-plan-public-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the bills keep in place several popular parts of the ACA, including requiring insurers to cover preexisting conditions, maternity care, and preventive services; allowing children to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26; and prohibiting annual or lifetime coverage limits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bills still have to be voted on by the House and Senate. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/372017-3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Democratic opposition&lt;/a&gt; is already in place and even some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/08/healthcare-reform-trump-republican-opposition&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; have concerns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the issue is far from over.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But here is a look at who could be affected by the legislation as it stands today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Millions could lose coverage&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 2010 more than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-obamacare-uninsured-rate-20170214-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;20 million people&lt;/a&gt; gained insurance coverage as a result of the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This resulted from subsidies to offset the cost of premiums, state health insurance exchanges offering insurance, and the individual mandate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last one required most people to obtain health insurance or face tax penalties. This was to help keep premiums affordable for older, sicker people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But many young people still opted to pay the penalty and go without insurance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The penalties just weren’t onerous enough for the individual mandate,” said Mosley. “There’s got to be a different incentive for younger people to sign up.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Republican legislation will try to entice people to keep continuous coverage by charging them a 30 percent surcharge if they let their coverage lapse and then sign up again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The mandate requiring larger employers to provide affordable health insurance for their employees would also be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/07/small-business-groups-glad-to-see-mandates-go-in-gop-healthcare-plan.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;repealed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also gone are the ACA income-based subsidies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These would be replaced by tax credits ranging from $2,000 for young adults to $4,000 for older adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it’s not necessarily an even swap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The ACA offered subsidies at a higher rate than the proposed AHCA legislation, which uses a sliding scale of tax credits. This change would most impact poor, older adults,” Michael Topchik, national leader for the Chartis Center for Rural Health, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This change, say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/health/risk-of-losing-health-insurance-in-republican-plan.html?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;analysts&lt;/a&gt;, could result in millions of people losing coverage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/health/american-medical-association-opposes-republican-health-plan.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Medical Association&lt;/a&gt; echoed concerns about the potential loss of coverage. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group emphasized that tax credits need to “be sufficient to enable one to afford quality coverage” and tied to a person’s income to make better use of taxpayers’ money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coverage is important because it allows people to seek earlier treatment from primary care doctors rather than needing more expensive critical care later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think we have to create a plan that makes coverage more affordable and expands the choice,” said Mosley, “but doesn’t drive Americans to the emergency room.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Older adults and those with low incomes impacted&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In particular, the loss of subsidies would impact people with low incomes, and Americans in their 50s and 60s, who could face higher premiums.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Republican plan would allow insurers to charge older Americans five times as much for premiums as they do their youngest customers. Under the ACA, this was capped at three times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Before people even reach retirement age, big insurance companies could be allowed to charge them an age tax that adds up to thousands of dollars more per year,” Nancy LeaMond, AARP’s executive vice president, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/322861-aarp-rips-gops-harmful-healthcare-legislation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lobbying group for older adults also blasted the legislation’s provisions for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/upshot/gop-health-bill-would-cut-funding-for-poor-and-taxes-on-rich.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reducing federal funding for Medicaid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these changes would especially impact Americans in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The repeal of the individual mandate may leave fewer rural patients — who represent some of the older, poorer, and sicker members of our population — without health coverage in the future,” said Topchik.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could increase the strain on rural hospitals, which have been &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/rural-hospitals-closing&quot;&gt;closing&lt;/a&gt; at an alarming rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have little doubt that this will mean fewer may be able to afford health coverage,” said Topchik, “which would ultimately increase the burden on rural providers.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two key &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/03/07/519020153/trump-supports-gop-health-care-plan-but-it-isn-t-everything-he-wants?sc=17&amp;amp;f=1001http://www.npr.org/2017/03/07/519020153/trump-supports-gop-health-care-plan-but-it-isn-t-everything-he-wants?sc=17&amp;amp;f=1001&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;healthcare changes&lt;/a&gt; pushed by President Trump, though, are not included in the bills — reigning in rising costs of prescription medications and allowing people to purchase insurance across state lines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever the bills look like when they make it through the House and Senate, some experts are hoping that the changes are worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If it doesn’t cut costs and it doesn’t improve healthcare coverage and make our patient population better, why change it?” said Mosley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Lee, assistant professor of radiology at UCLA’s David Geffen School of Medicine, and one of the authors of the study, said he and his colleagues theorized they could use artificial intelligence in low-cost, automated ways to improve patient care. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fundamental technology that has made self-driving cars possible is deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence modeled after the connections in the human brain,” explained Dr. Kevin Seals, resident physician in diagnostic radiology at UCLA Health, and a study co-author, said in a Healthline interview. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seals, who programmed the VIR, said advanced computers and the human brain have a number of similarities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Using deep learning, computers are now essentially as good as humans at identifying particular objects, making it possible for self-driving cars to ‘see’ and appropriately navigate their environment,” he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This same technology can allow computers to understand complex text inputs such as medical questions from healthcare professionals,” he added. “By implementing deep learning using the IBM Watson cognitive technology and Natural Language Processing, we are able to make our ‘virtual interventional radiologist’ smart enough to understand questions from physicians and respond in a smart, useful way.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How does VIR work?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Think of it as an initial, superfast layer of information gathering that can be used prior to taking the time to contact an actual human diagnostic or interventional radiologist, Seals said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The user simply texts a question to the virtual radiologist, which in many cases provides an excellent, evidence-based response more or less&amp;nbsp;instantaneously,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted that if the patient doesn’t receive a helpful response, they are rapidly referred to a human radiologist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Tools such as our chatbot are particularly important in the current clinical environment, which focuses on quality metrics and follows evidence-based clinical guidelines that are proven to help patients,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seals said a team of academic radiologists curated the information provided in the application from the radiology literature, and it is rigorously scientific and evidence-based. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We hope that using the application will encourage cutting-edge patient management that results in improved patient care and significantly benefits our patients,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It can be thought of as ‘texting’ with a virtual representation of a human radiologist that offers a significant chunk of the functionality of speaking with an actual human radiologist,” Seals said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the non-radiologist clinician texts a question to the VIR, deep learning is used to understand that message and respond in an intelligent manner. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We get a lot of questions that are fairly readily automated,” Seals said. “Such as ‘I am worried that my patient has a blood clot in their lungs. What is the best type of imaging to perform to make the diagnosis?’ The chatbot can respond to questions like this in a supersmart, evidence-based way.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sample responses, he said, can include instructive images (for example, a flowchart that shows a clinical algorithm), response text messages, and subprograms within the application — such as a calculator to determine a patient’s ‘Wells’ score,’ a metric doctors use to guide clinical management.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The VIR application resembles an online customer service chat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To create a crucial foundation of knowledge, the researchers fed the app more than 2,000 data points that simulated the common inquiries interventional radiologists receive when they meet with patients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;VIR becomes smarter with each use&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a referring clinician asks a question, the extensive knowledge base of the app allows it to respond instantly with the best answer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The various forms of responses can include websites, infographics, and custom programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the VIR determines that an answer requires a human response, the program will provide contact information for a human interventional radiologist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The app learns as clinicians use it, and each scenario teaches the VIR to become increasingly smarter and more powerful, Seals said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nature of chatbot communications should protect patient privacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Confidentiality is “critically important in the world of modern technology and something we take very seriously,” Seals said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added that the application was created and programmed by physicians with extensive HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) training. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are able to avoid these issues because users ask questions in a general and anonymous manner,” Seals said. “Protected health information is never needed to use the application, nor is it relevant to its function.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All users — professional healthcare providers such as physicians and nurses — must agree to not include any specific protected patient information in their texts to the chatbot, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;None of the diverse functionality within the application requires specific patient information, Seals said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Improving speed and efficiency of care&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new technology represents the fastest and easiest way for clinicians to get the information they need in the hospital, starting with radiology and eventually expanding to other specialties such as neurosurgery and cardiology, Seals said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our technology can power any type of physician chatbot,” he explained. “Currently, there are information silos of sorts that exist between various specialists in the hospital, and there is no good tool for rapidly sharing information between these silos. It is often slow and difficult to get a busy radiologist on the phone, which inconveniences clinicians and delays patient care.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other clinicians at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine are testing the chatbot, and Seals and Lee say their technology is fully functional now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are refining it and perfecting it so it can thrive in a wide release,” Seals said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seals’ engineering and software background allowed him to perform the necessary programming for the as-yet unfunded research project. He said he and his colleagues will seek funding as they expand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This breakthrough technology will debut soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The VIR will be made available in about one month to all clinicians at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. Further use at UCLA will help the team to refine the chatbot for wider release.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The VIR could also become a free app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are exploring potential models for releasing the application,” Seals said. “It may very well be a free tool we release to assist our clinician colleagues, as we are academic radiologists focused on sharing knowledge and improving clinical medicine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers described the importance of the VIR in a summary of their findings: “Improved artificial intelligence through deep learning has the potential to fundamentally transform our society, from automated image analysis to the creation of self-driving cars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
gt;&lt;p&gt;During menopause, women can experience a range of symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats, fatigue, and vaginal dryness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), also referred to as estrogen replacement therapy, is widely used to counter these side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because HRT is so commonly used, it has received a great deal of attention from researchers. Benefits have been weighed against concerns and scientific &lt;a href=&quot;http://annals.org/aim/article/1169676/menopausal-hormone-therapy-primary-prevention-chronic-conditions-systematic-review-update&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opinion has shifted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the positive side, HRT has been found to lower the risk of osteoporosis and improve certain measures of heart health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conversely, other studies have demonstrated a link between HRT and an increased risk of cancer and stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Concerns surrounding these risks have created a sharp decline in the number of women using HRT over the past 15 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Reopening the HRT debate&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new study, being presented on March 17 at the American College of Cardiology’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://accscientificsession.acc.org/Registration-and-Hotels?_ga=1.76225813.1695365780.1488999184&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;66th Annual Scientific Session &amp;amp; Expo&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, D.C., might nudge public opinion back the other way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study is titled “Hormone replacement therapy is associated with less coronary atherosclerosis and lower mortality” and it’s guaranteed to spark discussion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers looked retrospectively at the data of more than 4,200 women who received a coronary calcium scan at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles between 1998 and 2012. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A coronary calcium scan measures calcium buildup in coronary arteries. Higher calcium levels are a marker for plaque buildup and, consequently, signal an increased risk of heart attack or stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the participants included, 41 percent were using HRT at the time of their scan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HRT use was at its highest between 1998 and 2002 and slowly declined across the study period, dropping from 60 percent in 1998 to 23 percent in 2012.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Around 6 percent of the women died during the study follow-up, which spanned an average of eight years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the analysis, the data were adjusted for coronary calcium score, age, and a range of cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because those in the HRT group were older than those in the non-HRT group (64 versus 60, respectively), the researchers also adjusted for this discrepancy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once all variables were accounted for, the team found that women using HRT were 30 percent less likely to die than those not taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Similarly, women on HRT were 20 percent more likely to have a zero score on the coronary calcium scan - the lowest possible score, indicating minimal heart attack risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were also 36 percent less likely to have a coronary calcium score above 399 - a score linked with severe atherosclerosis and high heart attack risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers’ conclusions are clear, but they also call for caution. Dr. Yoav Arnson, a visiting postdoctoral scientist at Cedars-Sinai and lead study author, says:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hormone replacement therapy resulted in lower atherosclerosis and improved survival for all age groups and for all levels of coronary calcium. From this, we do think it is beneficial, but we would need prospective or randomized studies to determine which groups might not benefit or even be harmed by this therapy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The protective abilities of HRT&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This large-scale study provides evidence that HRT exerts a protective effect on cardiovascular health, but how might this work?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Estrogen’s positive influence on heart health involves at least two pathways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, estrogen &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/estrogen-hormones-heart-health&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reduces levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of low-density lipoprotein, or “bad,” cholesterol, and increases high-density lipoprotein, or “good,” cholesterol. Secondly, estrogen increases flexibility in blood vessels and arteries, helping them to cope with changes in flow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before menopause, women have high levels of estrogen in their systems and, typically, have levels of cardiovascular health equivalent to that of men 10-20 years younger than them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, after menopause, estrogen levels plummet and heart disease risk increases as a result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HRT replaces this lost estrogen, reinstating its protective abilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the current study is large and has a longer-than-average follow-up time, it does not reveal the specific groups of women that might benefit from the treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also doesn’t add to the understanding of other risks associated with HRT, such as cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the current findings come down heavily in favor of HRT, a decision to begin treatment will still be a complex choice for an individual and their doctor to make. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Universal Cancer Vaccine is Highly Unlikely</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/030817_cancervaccine_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a simple reason a universal cancer vaccine will probably never be developed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are too many types of cancers and they are quite different from each other.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New research published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-017-0408-2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Genome Medicine&lt;/a&gt; provides insights into the challenges of developing such a comprehensive cancer vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A broad or semi-universal vaccine capable of targeting many different tumors would be seen by some as the ‘Holy Grail’ of cancer therapy, as it wouldn't involve the time or cost of individualizing treatment,” Dr. Ryan Hartmaier, lead author from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foundationmedicine.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Foundation Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170223202031.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A successful cancer vaccine must recognize the biological molecule in a tumor that is foreign. Then it must turn the immune system against it. To do that, you have to identify the specific target.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research team performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of more than 60,000 unique tumors. They were searching for sets of genetic alterations that could be targeted to develop a semi-universal cancer vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their findings show how unlikely that is. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where the research stands&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This research reveals how powerful the molecular analysis of tumors has become,” Dr. Mark Faries told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Faries is a surgical oncologist. He’s also director of the Donald L. Morton, MD, Melanoma Research Program, and director of Therapeutic Immunology at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at &lt;a href=&quot;http://california.providence.org/saint-johns/find-a-doctor/f/faries-mark-b/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Providence Saint John's Health Center&lt;/a&gt; in California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said vaccine development alternates between enthusiasm and disappointment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hopes were high early on. Then researchers realized the complexity of the relationship between cancer and the immune system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Now we have a much better understanding of how the immune system works and its interaction with cancers. There’s a lot of excitement again. Particularly with the development of immune-modulating therapies for cancers that work with the immune system,” said Faries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These drugs amplify the immune response. The goal of a vaccine is to create one of those responses,” he added. “There is reason to think a combination of new drugs and vaccines will be particularly effective. But they won’t work for all.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Faries, who has long been involved in cancer vaccine development trials, expressed doubt about the feasibility of a broad cancer vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The new research shows that there’s too much variability from patient to patient and tumor to tumor to devise something that would work for everyone,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m not sure [a universal cancer vaccine] has ever been anyone’s realistic goal … We can’t even do that with the flu vaccine. I don’t think there will be a single vaccine or pill to treat all cancers. But that’s not a requirement for cancer treatment. We target therapies and vaccines for specific disease,” said Faries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don J. Diamond, PhD, told Healthline, “In actuality, this is a refinement of studies that have been published in numerous journals.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diamond is chair and professor at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cityofhope.org/research/beckman-research-institute/research-departments-and-divisions/experimental-therapeutics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Department of Experimental Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt; at City of Hope in California. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Certainly, a wide variety of mutations can contribute to the development of cancer. Because those mutations are unique, the development of a generalized cancer vaccine to cover all those driver mutations is hard to envision with today’s technology,” Diamond said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diamond added there are a few genes, such as TP53, that are associated with a lot of cancers. But there’s another problem in coming up with a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What caused the mutation in the first place may have nothing do with the cancer itself, or the driving force for metastasis. At the time of therapy, the early event may no longer be responsible,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vaccines to treat certain types of cancer &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A broad approach aside, vaccines can be used to treat specific types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors are already treating some cancers with immune checkpoint modulators. By directing the immune system toward a specific target, a vaccine may prevent recurrence. It may also enhance the effects of other immunotherapies, according to Faries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The HER2/neu, the mutant protein most commonly found in breast cancer, led to drugs like &lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/trastuzumab/injectable-solution&quot;&gt;trastuzumab&lt;/a&gt;,” said Faries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Efforts are underway to develop vaccines against that same protein. Not only in breast cancer, but in gastric and other cancers as well. Possibly across a broader spectrum of cancers that express that particular abnormality.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Faries cautioned that some of the more advanced vaccine approaches would probably be too expensive to think about in a wide population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Vaccines to prevent specific cancers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diamond said there are obstacles to preventive vaccines for specific cancers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s very hard to predict what type of cancer someone would get, or when they would develop it. You’d have to balance the present with the future, and reward with unknown risks,” he said. “Will the side effect of trying to prevent one cancer be the acceleration of another? We don’t know enough to make those decisions ethically or morally.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eliminating viral-based cancers is a much safer strategy, said Diamond. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Faries agrees. “The most successful preventive vaccines are generally those that protect from causative agents,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An example of this is the hepatitis B vaccine. It helps prevent liver cancer caused by hepatitis. Another example is the HPV vaccine. It helps prevent HPV-related cancers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where we go from here&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study results like these can be disappointing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That doesn’t mean cancer researchers will stop trying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a survival benefit to understanding cancer,” said Sandra Brown, MS, LCGC, cancer genetics program manager at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjo.org/Our-Services/The-Center-for-Cancer-Prevention-and-Treatment.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Center for Cancer Prevention and Treatment&lt;/a&gt; at St. Joseph Hospital in California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cancer is basically evolution on steroids,” she wrote in an email to Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We consciously create a healthy environment, although aging alone can lead to the accumulation of mutations necessary for tumorigenesis. Then we treat to create a hostile environment while the cancer may evolve multiple clonal pathways in an attempt to reproduce successfully within that environment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She continued, “Perhaps often we win and the tumor dies. But there is always the possibility that lethally resistant random mutations will occur anytime in tumorigenesis, particularly during treatment. Genetically modified humans may someday be immune to tumorigenesis, or attenuated viruses may someday perfectly recognize tumor cells for targeted destruction.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Preventing cancer now&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Broad therapeutic or preventive cancer vaccines won’t happen anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This makes other methods of cancer prevention that much more important. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first step, according to Faries, is understanding the cause. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We already know what causes some cancers. But prevention is still a problem, he explained. That’s because you have to apply this knowledge to a wide population who might not be intent on following through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Smoking is a classic example. You can tell people until you’re blue in the face that smoking kills. But they continue to smoke,” said Faries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His suggestion is that people should consider their family history and other risk factors. If you’re more likely to get a certain type of cancer, learn the prevention measures. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diamond has a few words of advice for anyone trying to lower their cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Protect yourself from the sun, don’t smoke, manage your weight, and don’t eat charcoaled foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Starting in the 1970s, they followed each other to northern Texas from their hometown of General Teran. But over the past nine years, food has been a source of conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back then, Aurelio Arias, the youngest of the clan, announced he was becoming a vegan, meaning he’d no longer eat meat or dairy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His wife Lily and their eldest son, Aurelio Arias Jr., became vegan about three years later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aurelio’s sister Andrea Alaniz and their mother became vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Javier stopped drinking soda and started eating mostly fruits, beans and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was about getting healthier and living longer for their families, they said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Family gatherings not the same&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But their new food choices have come at the expense of family harmony.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Holidays and weekend barbecues have never been the same.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relatives who still eat meat feel rejected when the siblings and their mother don’t eat the food they serve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aurelio and Lily often offend relatives when they bring vegan dishes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aurelio and Javier have been left out of weddings and quinceaneras, the coming-of-age celebration when girls turn 15. Sometimes, they’ve chosen not to go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Older brother Concepcion Arias said the separation hurts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve grumbled about it because they can’t share in the experience [with everyone else],” said the 61-year-old father of five.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why food matters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Arias’ conflict doesn’t surprise two longtime food and culture historians who say the foods we eat are more than nourishment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are loaded with meaning about love of family, friends, classes and heritage, the academics said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People do believe we pass along culture through food,” said Alice P. Julier, Ph.D., the director of the food studies program at Chatham University’s Falk School of Sustainability and the Environment. “Language often goes away. But food is something that people supposedly can maintain and celebrate.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And eating the same foods together is one way people strengthen their heritage and relationships with relatives, said Amy Bentley, Ph.D., a professor of food studies at New York University’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Changing what we eat — even if it’s for health reasons — could be interpreted as making a break from family unity, she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Food ways, I think, is almost as prominent as religion in terms of how people create ethnic and religious identity,” said Bentley, whose research has focused on food and American culture and society for more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the mostly Hispanic and Latino patients she sees at a San Antonio clinic, dietitian Dahlia Gomez has noticed a pattern among families of patients who change what they eat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the person has health problems, relatives give unconditional support, said Gomez. But, she said, if a family member makes a personal choice to stop eating foods the family has eaten for generations, they’re less accepting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Health concerns drive changes in diet&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aurelio was the first to change his diet, which had been heavy on beef and low on fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 48-year-old restaurant owner quit eating meat and dairy after he was rushed to a hospital with chest pains. His blood pressure was dangerously high and he had to be hospitalized. He missed his father’s funeral as doctors monitored his heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aurelio was no stranger to heart problems. His father had survived a heart attack, and his paternal grandfather’s stroke was linked to high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I love my family and I didn’t want to die,” Aurelio said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back then, Javier also had health problems: high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. After seeing his younger brother’s health improve, Javier changed his eating habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, the brothers have each lost more than 60 pounds and their blood pressure and cholesterol are back to normal. Javier also no longer needs medication to control his diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their sister Andrea changed the way she ate after medical exams showed she had a fatty liver.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;“I was addicted to steaks,” said the 63-year-old mother of five. “That was one of my favorite vices.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea has encouraged her meat-eating siblings to try the tacos and enchiladas Aurelio and Lily offer at their vegan Mexican restaurant. Some have come around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Concepcion still doesn’t support his family members’ meatless diet, despite having his own dietary restrictions to help manage his diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The construction company owner gets sentimental when he talks about the family’s festive gatherings back when everyone ate the childhood dishes they loved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When people share in the same experience, it’s more fun, you have a more enjoyable time,” Concepcion said. “Life feels easier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/food-family-and-the-health-scare-that-changed-it-all/&quot;&gt;original story&lt;/a&gt; was published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/ &quot;&gt;American Heart Association News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/heart-health/030717_dietheart_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of public health messages promoting healthy eating, most people now know that a poor diet can increase their risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But how much of an effect does diet have on your risk of dying from one of these diseases?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot — a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We combed through studies and data to look at the cumulative effects of poor diet on what we call cardiometabolic diseases — heart disease, stroke, and diabetes — and determined that nearly half of all deaths are linked to poor diet,” Renata Micha, RD, PhD, study author, and research assistant professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, another group of researchers says that fewer overweight and obese people are trying to lose weight, another factor leading to increased risk for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Effect of 10 dietary factors&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in the diet study used risk assessment models and national data on dietary habits to determine how many of the more than 700,000 deaths in 2012 from heart disease, stroke, or type 2 diabetes were due to poor diet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They estimated that 45 percent of the deaths were associated with 10 dietary factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Top on the list was excess intake of sodium, which researchers estimated accounted for almost 10 percent of the deaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it’s not just about eating too many foods that are bad for our health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Americans are overconsuming salt, processed meats, and sugary-sweetened beverages,” said Micha. “We are underconsuming fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, whole grains, vegetable oils, or fish.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vegetable oils like those found in soybeans, sunflower seeds, and walnuts are high in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/Polyunsaturated-Fats_UCM_301461_Article.jsp#.WL6uEhLyt68&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;polyunsaturated fats&lt;/a&gt;, which are known to reduce harmful cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/HealthyDietGoals/Fish-and-Omega-3-Fatty-Acids_UCM_303248_Article.jsp#.WL7dPxLyt68&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fatty fish&lt;/a&gt; like salmon, mackerel, herring, and sardines are high in heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Non-fish sources of omega-3s are also available — like flaxseeds, chia seeds, and microalgae — but were not looked at in this study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the study, diet accounted for a greater fraction of deaths among African-Americans and Hispanics compared with whites, as well as among adults with low levels of education compared to those with high levels of education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers also estimated a stronger effect of diet on risk of death in men, which they write is “primarily because of generally unhealthier dietary habits.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a wake-up call and another opportunity,” said Micha. “We need to be reminded of this simple truth: eating healthy can and will prevent people from dying prematurely from heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2017.0947&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was published Mar. 7 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Positive dietary changes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a related &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2608201&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA, Noel Mueller, PhD, MPH, and Dr. Lawrence Appel, MPH, caution that the results of the study are from observational research rather than stronger long-term randomized trials, which are difficult to do in nutritional research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So there is potential that other factors not included in the study may influence the risk of dying. This could include non-dietary factors like income and physical activity levels, or a person’s overall dietary pattern.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is possible that processed meat consumption merely reflects a Westernized dietary pattern,” write Mueller and Appel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also question whether these 10 dietary factors are the best ones to monitor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Saturated fat didn’t make the study’s list, but “randomized trials conducted decades ago demonstrated that replacement of saturated fat with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced cardiovascular disease events by 18 percent to 41 percent,” write Mueller and Appel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/Saturated-Fats_UCM_301110_Article.jsp#.WL7l2BIrJ68&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Saturated fats&lt;/a&gt; come mainly from meat and dairy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In spite of those concerns, Mueller and Appel write that the “likely benefits [of an improved diet] are substantial and justify policies designed to improve diet quality.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new study identified a reduction in sodium intake as a prime target for public health policy, something that is already under way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently announced voluntary sodium reduction targets for the food industry,” said Micha. “This is quite timely and we need to engage industry to gradually reduce salt content in processed foods.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She also points to &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/the-skinny-on-soda-taxes-010216&quot;&gt;taxes on sugary beverages&lt;/a&gt; passed by U.S. municipalities in recent years as a sign of progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, she highlighted promising initiatives like programs in the workplace and schools to promote healthier eating, and improvements in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for people in the United States with low or no income.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even without the government’s help, people can take charge of their own health — even if it is one small change at a time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Eat more of the good and less of the bad,” said Micha. “Start by making one healthier choice each day and build on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Fewer trying to lose weight&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes not addressed by the new study is being overweight or obese.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, more than two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese. And one-fifth of adolescents are obese.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as overweight and obesity have increased in the United States, fewer people are trying to lose weight, report the authors of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jama.2016.20036&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research letter&lt;/a&gt; published in the same issue of JAMA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers used the responses of more than 27,000 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to determine shifts in weight loss over the past few decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overweight and obesity among adults increased during that time — from 53 percent during the period from 1988 to 1994, to 66 percent during the period from 2009 to 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the same period, the percentage of overweight or obese adults trying to lose weight declined — from 56 percent in 1988 to 1994 to 49 percent in 2009 to 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study author Dr. Jian Zhang, DrPH, an epidemiologist at Georgia Southern University, and colleagues, write that this “may be due to body weight misperception reducing motivation to engage in weight loss efforts or primary care clinicians not discussing weight issues with patients.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;If you think the debate over the safety of childhood vaccines is going to go away soon, think again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If anything, it’s likely to get more heated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After all, this is an issue that centers on the health and safety of children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who are dubious of vaccines think children are being harmed to the extent that some of them develop autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who champion vaccines feel the antivaccination movement is putting public health at risk by lowering herd immunity and sending unvaccinated kids into schools and other community spaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The issues involved may not be as simple as one might think, and the reasons they get such public traction are varied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who question the safety of vaccines blame greedy pharmaceutical companies, corrupt government officials, and biased scientific studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who are adamant that vaccines are safe blame an out-of-control social media scene, nonexpert celebrities, and a growing antiscience mood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This heated battle is starting to boil as a new, more conservative administration settles in at the White House — one that some feel &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/anti-vaccination-may-get-boost-in-trump-administration&quot;&gt;may encourage&lt;/a&gt; vaccine opponents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s sad and scary. I’m worried about the direction we are going,” Cynthia Leifer, PhD, an associate professor of immunology at Cornell University, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How the vaccine safety issue grew&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The antivaccination movement got its first big booster shot in 1998 when Dr. Andrew Wakefield and 12 colleagues published research in The Lancet journal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wakefield said his case studies had shown the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine could be linked to a rise in autism cases in children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;number of faults&lt;/a&gt; were eventually uncovered in Wakefield’s research. Among them was the small sample size of 12 people as well as his ties to private companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lancet &lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/lancet-retracts-wakefield-article/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;retracted&lt;/a&gt; the study in 2010. That same year, the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/health/policy/25autism.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;banned Wakefield&lt;/a&gt; from practicing medicine, citing a number of ethical lapses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The antivaccination movement did get another boost from a more reputable source.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It came in the form of Dr. Bernadine Healy, a former director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and dean of Ohio State University Medical School.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De7DCpcyQfY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2008 interview&lt;/a&gt; with CBS News, Healy said government officials and scientists had been too quick to dismiss the concerns of families whose children became ill after receiving vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/us/09healy.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;died in 2011&lt;/a&gt; of brain cancer, but her words are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thevaccinereaction.org/2016/11/bernadine-healy-the-question-of-a-link-between-vaccines-and-autism-is-unanswered/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;still quoted&lt;/a&gt; by a number of antivaccination groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some celebrities then attached themselves to the cause.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the first was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.generationrescue.org/home/about/jenny-mccarthy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt;, the former Playboy Playmate, whose son was diagnosed with autism in 2005.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McCarthy went public with concerns about childhood vaccines and eventually formed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.generationrescue.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Generation Rescue&lt;/a&gt;, whose primary mission is to help families with autistic children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldmercuryproject.org/mercury-vaccines-cdcs-worst-nightmare/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, the son of Sen. Bobby Kennedy who was assassinated in 1968 while running for president.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthline.com/health-news/kennedy-q-a-about-vaccine-safety&quot;&gt;in-depth half-hour interview&lt;/a&gt; with Healthline, Kennedy said he got involved in the issue while representing people who said they had been stricken with mercury poisoning by coal-fired power plants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy formed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldmercuryproject.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Mercury Project&lt;/a&gt;, whose primary goal is to raise awareness about the serious dangers of mercury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to vaccines, the organization’s focus is on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloo%20dVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety%20/UCM298182.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thimerosal&lt;/a&gt;, a mercury-based preservative that was taken out of childhood vaccines in 2003, but is still used in flu vaccines that are given to children and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last month, Kennedy and actor Robert De Niro, whose son has autism spectrum disorder, held a press conference in which they announced they’d offer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/de-niro-kennedy-offer-100g-proof-vaccines-safe-article-1.2973956&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$100,000&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who can present them with a peer-reviewed study that proves thimerosal is safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics called the offer a publicity stunt, but the news conference received plenty of attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaccine supporters say the attention given to vaccine opponents is indicative of a new world of social media where a former Playboy model can become a leading expert on autism and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Social media allows individuals with a high profile to keep rehashing the issue,” said Leifer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s also the internet in general.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anybody can toss up a website, so for every &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/immunizations/Pages/Vaccine-Studies-Examine-the-Evidence.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; on healthchildren.org declaring that vaccines are safe there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ahrp.org/former-merck-scientists-sue-merck-alleging-mmr-vaccine-efficacy-fraud/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that details the lawsuit filed by former Merck scientists stating that the company intentionally skewed results from their MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to the antiscience mood, there is also a growing disdain for pharmaceutical companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s been fueled partly by stories of pharmaceutical firms charging what many in the public see as outrageous prices for products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These high-profile stories include Mylan’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2016/09/21/mylan-ceo-epipen-price-hike/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;price hike&lt;/a&gt; of its EpiPen for serious food allergy reactions, to the sudden &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/dandiamond/2015/12/03/what-martin-shkreli-says-now-i-shouldve-raised-prices-higher/#6d47f41e1362&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;5,000 percent price increase&lt;/a&gt; for the lifesaving drug Daraprim by Turing Pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On its site, the World Mercury Project says the pharmaceutical industry is a trillion dollar industry with vaccines bringing in &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldmercuryproject.org/mercury-in-vaccines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$25 billion&lt;/a&gt; in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say the “insatiable pharmaceutical industry” has 271 new vaccines under development at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the hope of raising annual vaccine sales to $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this kind of money and the health of children at stake, it’s probably no mystery why the arguments on both sides of the vaccine safety issue can get heated. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A look at the studies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaccine proponents cite study after study for their support of inoculations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among them are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2013/Childhood-Immunization-Schedule/ChildhoodImmunizationScheduleandSafety_RB.pdf&quot;

target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2001 study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, a special federal “vaccine court” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/12/AR2009021201391.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ruled in 2009&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines do not cause autism, and the families of autistic children are not entitled to compensation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/news/brain-scans-spot-early-signs-of-autism-in-high-risk-babies-1.21484&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study published last month&lt;/a&gt; reported that brain scans can sometimes spot signs of autism in babies with higher risk of developing the disease. Researchers say this counters the arguments that autism begins to show up in children at ages 3 and 4 after they have received vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt; say studies and rulings such as these have convinced them that vaccines are safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even the nonprofit organization Autism Speaks states on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autismspeaks.org/what-autism/learn-more-autism/what-causes-autism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that the “scientific evidence is clear” that vaccines do not cause autism. On their site, they have published a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.autismspeaks.org/science/science-news/no-mmr-autism-link-large-study-vaccinated-vs-unvaccinated-kids&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 study&lt;/a&gt; that concluded there was no link between the MMR vaccine and autism. That same year, the advocacy group issued a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/09/leading-autism-advocate-urges-vaccination/?utm_term=.5233862e139a&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;strong statement&lt;/a&gt; urging parents to have their children vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, opponents of vaccines are still not swayed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They note that the federal court that dismissed links between vaccines and autism has also awarded numerous families compensation for brain damage caused to their children by vaccines. Those judgments include high-profile cases in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-david-kirby/vaccine-court-autism-deba_b_169673.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2009&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/post2468343_b_2468343.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vaccine skeptics also list a series of allegations to back up their claims.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of these issues were first discussed by Healy a decade before her death and are outlined on a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fourteenstudies.org/index.html&quot;&gt;14 Studies&lt;/a&gt; page on McCarthy’s website Generation Rescue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The arguments, for and against&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the chief assertions of vaccine opponents is what they see as a correlation between the rise in autism rates and the increase in vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They report that autism rates in the United States have risen from 1 in 10,000 children in the 1980s to 1 in 110 children. At the same time, the number of recommended vaccinations has increased from 10 to 36.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy said the numbers are backed up by the stories from thousands of parents who talk about the seizures and autism symptoms their children developed after receiving vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What are the chances they all made up the same story,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaccine supporters, however, say two things happening at the same time doesn’t necessarily mean they’re connected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leifer said if you go outside after a rainstorm and worms are crawling on the ground that doesn’t mean it rained worms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Kathryn Edwards, the chair of the pediatrics department at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, agrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Two things that happen at the same time are not necessarily related to one another,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not everything that goes together is causational,” added Leifer. “There are other things that should be considered.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among them are environmental changes, diets, better diagnostic tools, and more awareness of diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy and others are also focused on mercury, a compound they say is the second deadliest toxin on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For vaccines, they’ve homed in on thimerosal, the mercury-based preservative still found in flu shots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy said his group has more than six dozen studies that establish a link between thimerosal and autism. He says there are no studies that exonerate the ingredient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said that means our country is pumping high levels of mercury into children and pregnant women when they are given flu shots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t understand why everybody isn’t upset,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaccine opponents, however, say there are studies that have declared thimerosal safe, at least the amount used in vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has printed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/cc-thim.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a list of research&lt;/a&gt; that disputes a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The bottom line is that raising an issue about thimerosal is a purposeful attempt to sow seeds of doubt about the safety of vaccines that save the lives of children,” said Leifer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A lot of scientific research is disputed by vaccine opponents, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say a lot of the studies are heavily influenced by the powerful pharmaceutical industry. They compare the situation to the tobacco companies’ involvement in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20071114_cardio-tobacco/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lung cancer research&lt;/a&gt; and the sugar industry’s coercion in &lt;a&gt;tooth decay research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The [vaccine] research has been designed and written by the industry,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The opponents also say the studies on vaccines and autism have only been done on the MMR inoculations. They add there are also no studies comparing vaccinated children with unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jon Cohen, a staff writer for the journal Science, published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), said vaccine skeptics are asking this question in reverse order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You can’t prove a negative. Flip these questions on their heads,” he told Healthline. “What evidence links vaccines to autism? What evidence links thimerosal doses used in vaccines to harm?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leifer and Edwards both said there has been some research done comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated children. However, those studies are difficult to set up because of the low number of children who haven’t received those vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaccine opponents also say there is corruption within government agencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the 14 Studies page, the opponents say “studies are rife with conflicts” between study authors as well as government officials and industry representatives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kennedy said there are a “tiny handful of corrupt scientists and leaders” who are protected by the silence of many others who work with them at agencies like the CDC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He compares it to the cover-up of priest pedophilia in the Catholic Church that was uncovered by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/spotlight-movie&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/a&gt; and detailed in the movie, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1895587/&quot;&gt;Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, vaccine supporters see these accusations as nothing more than far-fetched conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Vaccine safety is something we take very seriously,” said Edwards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The impact of the debate&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Concerns over vaccines are nothing new.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen notes that there have been safety issues since Edward Jenner developed the smallpox vaccine, the world’s first inoculation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nor is vaccine safety confined to the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/france-most-skeptical-country-about-vaccine-safety&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016 survey&lt;/a&gt;, researchers said people in France showed the highest concern over vaccines of the 66 countries studied. In that European nation, 41 percent disagreed with the notion that vaccines are safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cohen said vaccines can cause harm. He noted the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cutter Incident&lt;/a&gt; in 1955 when a defective batch of vaccines actually caused 40,000 cases of polio in children. There was also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120507131953.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;STEP study&lt;/a&gt; in which some men who received a vaccine designed to protect against HIV ended up at higher risk of being infected by the virus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite these cases, Cohen said, there is a reward vs. risk factor that needs to be considered. That is sometimes clouded by a relative lack of exposure to disease in modern society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unlike in the smallpox or polio era, parents typically have never seen the damage done by the diseases they are vaccinating against, and there’s little understanding of herd immunity — the idea that if a certain percent of a population is immune, a pathogen stops spreading,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Edwards agreed, saying some younger parents may not have had measles or mumps as a child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They’re not nice things to have,” she commented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leifer also asks people to look at the success rate of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been no &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/faq/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;smallpox cases&lt;/a&gt; anywhere in the world since 1978. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Polio used to cause 15,000 cases of paralysis a year in the United States before the vaccine was introduced in the 1950s. There has not been a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/polio/us/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;polio case&lt;/a&gt; that originated in the United States since 1979.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rates of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mumps&lt;/a&gt; in the United States have been significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s any way you can argue against that,” said Leifer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaccine critics still see the decrease in certain diseases being offset by the rise in autism and other ailments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Leifer says the debate over vaccine safety is hurting efforts to win the battle against autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s slowing down the race to find out what exactly causes autism,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/Vaccination/030717_rkjr_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the chairman of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldmercuryproject.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Mercury Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nonprofit organization’s goal is to “ban all uses of mercury on a global level.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group states that &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldmercuryproject.org/world-mercury-project-overview/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mercury&lt;/a&gt; is the second most toxic element on Earth and can cause inflammation in brain tissue. That inflammation has been connected to autism, Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and other ailments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group says mercury is released into the air by coal-fired power plants and can be found in our food supply.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mercury is also in thimerosal, a preservative that in the past&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.6px;&quot;&gt;was used in some but not all childhood vaccines. The ingredient was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/timeline.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 13.6px;&quot;&gt;removed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.6px;&quot;&gt; as a safety precaution in 2003.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 13.6px;&quot;&gt;Thimerosal is still used in flu and tetanus shots.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) say &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloo%20dVaccines/SafetyAvailability/VaccineSafety%20/UCM298182.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thimerosal is safe&lt;/a&gt; to use as a preservative in vaccines, but Kennedy and others aren’t convinced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They point out that flu shots are given to pregnant women as well as children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group feels strongly enough about the issue that they held a press conference last month and offered a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/de-niro-kennedy-offer-100g-proof-vaccines-safe-article-1.2973956&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$100,000 reward&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who can present a peer-reviewed study that proves that thimerosal is safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthline has taken a look at both sides of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthline.com/health-news/debate-over-vaccine-safety&quot;&gt;vaccination debate&lt;/a&gt; in a detailed article.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of that research, Healthline talked with Kennedy about his concerns. Here are excerpts from that half-hour interview.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthline: &lt;/strong&gt;Why is this issue so important to you?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy:&lt;/strong&gt; I was litigating and managing around 30 cases against coal-fired power plants, principally focusing on mercury emissions. I had learned a lot about mercury toxicity. I was going around the country speaking on the issue and I began running into women who would tell me that if I was truly interested in mercury exposures to children that I needed to look at thimerosal in vaccines … As I began reading the science, I was struck by the huge delta between what the actual science said and how it was being presented by the press and the public health regulators … It made me angry that they were continuing the practice of injecting children with neurotoxins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthline:&lt;/strong&gt; It seems that there is an element in here of fighting against big business. It seems that you could compare this to what the sugar and the tobacco industry did with science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy: &lt;/strong&gt;Sugar, tobacco, the carbon industry. They all did this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthline:&lt;/strong&gt; Do you see a similarity here?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s very similar. This is really almost identical to the global warming debate because you have all the independent science … saying there is an effect. In other words, that carbon is warming the globe and with neurodevelopment disorders [that] mercury in vaccines are causing [them]. Then you have a small [amount] of industry-created science … that purportedly exonerates thimerosal and is really designed and written by industry scientists … and it appears on the CDC’s website. But the science is weak and fraudulent … We brought to our press conference 321 studies … 240 studies on neurological effects other than autism and 81 studies indicating a link to autism. We could not find a single study that says thimerosal was safe … What the CDC tells you is not science. What The New York Times reports is not science. And what your doctor tells you is not science … If you look at [studies] done by research scientists you will find a mountain of studies that support my position and very, very few studies that dispute me.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthline:&lt;/strong&gt; What about vaccines in general? Would you agree that the vast majority of science says vaccines in general are safe?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s not my expertise. I don’t think there is any study you can do that would say that particular thing. I think you’d have to look vaccine by vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthline:&lt;/strong&gt; It seems your main concern is the flu shot, which is given to children and pregnant woman. Is that your focus?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s being given to children at 6 months and it’s being given to pregnant women. So, today the exposure a child suffers is probably the greatest in history. If you give a flu shot to a woman who is one or two months pregnant, that child could be getting thousands of times of exposure levels to mercury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthline: &lt;/strong&gt;You’re talking about a pretty big cover-up or conspiracy here. Do you really think those agencies are in cahoots? That there’s all this corruption within the industry? Because that’s what it would take to pull this off?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy:&lt;/strong&gt; The CDC has systemically [within its vaccine branch] ordered its scientists to destroy data, to manipulate data, to massage it, to dump it in garbage cans [if it uncovers] links between development diseases and vaccines. Do I think everyone at the CDC is corrupt? Of course not. There is a tiny handful of corrupt scientists and leaders … The rest of the public health community is not part of any conspiracy, but it has [become part of] the orthodoxy. It’s the same as the pedophile scandal in the Catholic Church … There was a tiny handful of corrupt priests, but the entire church — the bishops, the cardinals, the Vatican, and the other priests — and the prosecutors and the press and the police … told themselves it was more important to protect the institution even though it was injuring the children it was supposed to be protecting. The scandal and silence went on for years before it was exposed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthline:&lt;/strong&gt; Why would this handful [of CDC employees] do this?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy: &lt;/strong&gt;[When information on thimerosal reached CDC officials]&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;they said that if we come clean about this, not only are we going to get sued, but the vaccine companies are going to get sued, and they won’t be able to make any vaccines. I think there was a worry ... that if they told the truth, that the American people would lose faith and the institution would be so badly injured that maybe it would create even bigger problems with public health … It’s not completely selfish … There was a genuine concern that this could destroy the whole program and they had to clean it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthline: &lt;/strong&gt;Are you worried at all that some of the antivaccination campaigns … could do just that? That they could harm the overall vaccine industry and cause harm to public health?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t see how they can do that because Congress has now passed a law that makes it virtually impossible to sue a vaccine company.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthline:&lt;/strong&gt; Taking this a little broader, do you worry at all that some of the vaccine safety concerns from people might feed into the antiscience mood that seems to be building in the country and that includes climate change?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m trying to fight that trend and get people to pay attention to real science. There’s so much scientific illiteracy, especially in the press. The press doesn’t read science … They just parrot what the CDC tells them. Is there any other arena where the press thinks it’s OK to just parrot what a government official tells them?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthline:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s something folks on the other side have said … They think a lot of this is fueled by parents who understandably just want an answer, just something to blame, for their kids’ autism. What would be your response to that?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kennedy:&lt;/strong&gt; They are dismissing the stories of tens of thousands that saw the same thing happen to their children … What are the chances they all made up the same story? ... If this is not caused by mercury, then find out what it is and get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The company can use this voucher itself or sell it to another for hundreds of millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The program has had many successes — &lt;a href=&quot;http://khn.org/news/drugmakers-manipulate-orphan-drug-rules-to-create-prized-monopolies/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;450 orphan drugs&lt;/a&gt; have been brought to market since the act was signed into law by former President Ronald Reagan in 1983.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But critics are concerned the system is being abused to maximize profits, with companies using their near-monopoly on orphan drugs to charge exorbitant prices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, as with deflazacort, applying for orphan status — sometimes multiple times — for drugs that are already available on the market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This, they say, is a burden on families who worry about covering the costs of these drugs if their health insurance lapses or copayments and deductibles go up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why are orphan drugs so expensive?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some orphan drugs can cost as much as $804,000 per year, according to a report by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://khn.org/news/sky-high-prices-for-orphan-drugs-slam-american-families-and-insurers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kaiser Health Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The average price for orphan drugs is lower, but even that outpaces non-orphan drugs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://info.evaluategroup.com/rs/607-YGS-364/images/EPOD15.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on orphan drugs by EvaluatePharma, the average annual cost for orphan drugs was $111,820, compared with $23,331 for mainstream drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why are orphan drugs so expensive?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are no easy answers to the question why orphan drugs are relatively expensive,” Joshua Cohen, PhD, a research associate professor at Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One reason is that they serve small populations,” he said. “Another reason is that they are often unique products with no competitors.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With seven years of exclusive rights for an orphan drug for a particular disease, a company can set whatever price it wants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Companies say that the high prices are needed to recover the cost of research and development, which can be 20 to 30 years for a new drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://delauro.house.gov/sites/delauro.house.gov/files/Prescription-Drugs-Innovation-Spending-and-Patient-Access-12-07-16.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report to Congress&lt;/a&gt; last year by the Department of Health and Human Services, though, average development costs for an orphan drug are about $1 billion, compared with $2.6 billion for a mass market drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, as the Kaiser study points out, even with fewer patients taking them, orphan drugs can be big moneymakers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A $50,000 drug taken by 50,000 patients could bring in $2.5 billion per year for a company. A $300,000 orphan drug taken by only 5,000 people could net $1.5 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In spite of the smaller number of people affected by rare diseases, sales of orphan drugs are also expected to increase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2017/02/28/orphan-drugs-prices/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;StatNews&lt;/a&gt;, by 2022 orphan drugs will make up more than 21 percent of brand name prescription drug sales worldwide, an increase from 6 percent from 2000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EvaluatePharma also notes that seven of the 10 top-selling drugs in the world by sales are orphan drugs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Double dipping on orphan drugs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics say that drug companies have become increasingly savvy about utilizing the benefits of the Orphan Drug Act.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of particular concern are orphan drug applications for existing mass market drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Kaiser report, more than 70 orphan drugs were first approved by the FDA for mass market use. Many were approved for more than one disease, sometimes multiple ones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This includes deflazacort. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/drugs/tetrabenazine/oral-tablet&quot;&gt;Tetrabenazine&lt;/a&gt; was used for years to treat uncontrollable tremors in people with Huntington disease. According to the Washington Post, before its orphan drug status, a bottle of pills cost $42.28 from a European pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After orphan drug approval, the list price for a bottle of tetrabenazine in the United States was more than $6,000. The price was eventually increased to $21,243 a bottle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/orphan_drug_loophole_needs_closing_johns_hopkins_researchers_say&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; published in the American Journal of Clinical Oncology, Dr. Martin Makary at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, wrote that companies also exploit the law by focusing on just one of a drug’s uses — “one narrow enough to qualify for ‘orphan’ disease benefits.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After orphan drug approval, they then market the drug as off-label for other conditions, increasing their profits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How high prices affect patients&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest concerns is that the high prices for orphan drugs will limit access to them — which would have the opposite effect of the original intent of the law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Few people, if any, will pay the list price for an orphan drug. Drug companies have rebates and assistance programs to help offset the cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Insurance will also cover much of the cost for many people. But as insurance companies feel the price pressure of more people taking orphan drugs, they may ask people to pay more out of pocket or restrict access.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Insured U.S. patients face few outright denials of access to orphan drugs,” said Cohen, “but may incur high levels of patient cost-sharing and also certain conditions of reimbursement such as prior authorization.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For people on fixed incomes — such as those on Medicare or Medicaid — copayments of 20 percent of a drug’s cost can be a “considerable financial burden,” said Cohen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response to the Kaiser report in January, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and two other U.S. senators have &lt;a href=&quot;http://raps.org/Regulatory-Focus/News/2017/03/06/27032/Senators-Ask-GAO-to-Probe-Orphan-Drug-Act-as-Questions-Pile-up-Over-Marathon%E2%80%99s-Pricey-Steroid/#sthash.ZOK2nFFW.dpuf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) to look into abuse of the Orphan Drug Act.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marathon Pharmaceuticals already &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/company-pauses-release-89-000-muscular-dystrophy-drug-n720731&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; last week that it would “pause” its launch of Emflaza — the brand name of deflazacort — because of pricing concerns raised by patients and advocacy groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other critics echoed the concerns about abuse of the Orphan Drug Act.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If we are serious about lowering drug costs, we have to make sure that incentives created to spur innovation are used for groundbreaking research instead of simply fleecing the American people,” William Holley, spokesperson for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csrxp.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
ioid epidemic combined with the medical community’s inclination to prescribe drugs for pain management has created a perfect storm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The crisis has heightened the debate over the best way to treat people addicted to prescription drugs with many professionals agreeing that going “cold turkey” is not a viable solution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The dilemma comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) releases its most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/analysis.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent statistics&lt;/a&gt; on the state of the opioid epidemic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The agency reports that fatal drug overdoses have more than doubled since 1999. In 2015, 60 percent of all drug overdoses were from opioids, &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Health/fatal-drug-overdoses-doubled-1999-cdc-finds/story?id=45697327&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ABC News reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem has become so widespread the past few years, that it’s no longer a fringe topic. It was even intertwined in the presidential election last fall, with several journalists addressing the fact that areas ravaged by the crisis tended to be strongholds for President Donald Trump. They dubbed them the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-vote-results-drug-overdose-deaths-2016-11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Oxy electorate&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was hardly the only time the epidemic showed its face in politics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, offered a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2017/02/23/sean-spicer-wrongly-links-recreational-marijuana-with-opioid-crisis/#4b3f04cc3ea9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; last month on the role of marijuana in fostering the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, Maryland’s Republican Governor, Larry Hogan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/hogan-declares-opioid-state-of-emergency/2017/03/01/5c22fcfa-fe2f-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html?utm_term=.3b3b9e1be912&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;declared a state of emergency&lt;/a&gt; in response to the opioid crisis. The state is pledging an additional $50 million in an “all-hands-on-deck approach” that will include enforcement, prevention, and treatment services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No easy answers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jhsph.edu/news/news-releases/2017/many-patients-receive-prescription-opioids-during-medication-assisted-treatment-for-opioid-addiction.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; out of Johns Hopkins University concludes that part of the problem is that those who are dealing with opioid addiction have a high likelihood of being prescribed more narcotic drugs after addiction treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers looked at a cohort of 50 million people between 2006 and 2013 being prescribed buprenorphine, often referred to by its trade name Suboxone. The drug is widely used to treat opioid addiction by helping wean people with opioid addictions off of other drugs as well as softening the symptoms of withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the crux of the study is that, “Approximately two-fifths (43 percent) of buprenorphine recipients filled an opioid prescription during the treatment episode and two-thirds (67 percent) filled an opioid prescription following treatment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of patients that run into problems with opioids are using them exactly as prescribed, or at least are receiving these opioids from licensed prescribers,” said Dr. Caleb Alexander, the study’s co-author, and an associate professor of epidemiology and medicine at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alexander points to the very nature of our healthcare system as part of the culprit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We live in a very fragmented healthcare system,” he told Healthline, “and all too often the left hand may not know what the right hand is doing. This is particularly worrisome when it comes to the use of a medicine as potentially dangerous as a prescription opioid.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What this means in practical terms is that communication from one of a patient’s doctors to another isn’t necessarily all that great. If your dentist prescribes you something, your general practitioner likely won’t be aware of it (and vice versa) unless you bring it up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This situation gets even more complex when dealing with substances such as buprenorphine and methadone because these require special licensing for distribution. It’s unlikely you can see your regular doctor and walk out with a prescription for them. Instead, opioid abusers must often travel to specialized clinics where they can obtain tightly controlled doses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For many patients who are being treated for opiate addiction, this component of their care is sort of walled off or pursued separately from their routine primary care,” said Alexander.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the Obama administration did make some headway in making &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/07/06/484843560/obama-administration-eases-restrictions-on-doctors-who-treat-opioid-addiction&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;buprenorphine more accessible&lt;/a&gt; by easing restrictions on doctors’ ability to dispense it, the substance is still highly controlled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trying to slow prescriptions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;What the current research suggests is that without more oversight, these drugs’ efficacy is questionable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers note that the median length of a buprenorphine treatment was only 55 days, meaning the average user stuck with it for less than two months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within the current system, a patient dealing with opioid addiction could be prescribed buprenorphine and then several weeks or months into the treatment, the patient breaks their leg. In the emergency room, they are subsequently prescribed oxycodone for the pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there are some stopgaps in place. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rise of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) — statewide databases that allow physicians and pharmacies to see drug prescription records — are essential in helping to slow overprescription.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In terms of trying to get some sort of a flag going, pharmacists, when they see that people are on buprenorphine, have the ability to not fill an opiate prescription and in some cases, even a benzodiazepine prescription without notifying the prescribing physician,” Dr. Louis E. Baxter Sr., president of the Professional Assistance Program of New Jersey, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these systems are still limited and almost always restricted by state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baxter notes that being in a tristate area, the medical community is attempting to coordinate interstate databases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are earnest efforts being taken to sort of make these more of a regional and ultimately a national database,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dealing with pain&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is still a much larger issue at stake, of which PDMPs are only part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most crucial part of the opioid crisis narrative that research points to is that patients dealing with opioid dependence may also be dealing with legitimate pain issues. So, being prescribed buprenorphine and an additional opiate may in fact be “justified clinically.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, CDC Director, Dr. Tom Frieden, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/03/cdc-just-says-no-to-opioid-prescriptions-for-chronic-pain/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gone on record saying&lt;/a&gt;, “Plainly stated, the risks of opioids are addiction and death, and the benefits for chronic pain are often transient and generally unproven.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some have characterized what I would argue is a false conflict between, on the one hand, quality of care for those in pain, and on the other, reducing our overreliance on opioids,” said Alexander. “These two are not fundamentally in conflict.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For far too long, we’ve overrelied on prescription opioids at great cost to millions of Americans,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baxter agrees that pain management must be scrutinized, particularly for those who are not dealing with chronic issues. Sprains, breaks, and other short-term injuries may not need opioids at all. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most acute pain only lasts four to five days,” he said, pointing to more mundane, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as effective pain relievers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People get good pain management with those non-opiate medications,” Baxter said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, there are plenty of other pain solutions available, including massage therapy and physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Drugs alone aren’t the answer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Alexander and Baxter disagree with the notion that a drug like buprenorphine is effective on its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Anybody that is only being prescribed buprenorphine and is not having any counselling, they are all doomed, in my view, to return to use and abuse of opiates,” says Baxter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What should be done,” he continues, “is that when patients with opiate abuse issues present for treatment, they need to be evaluated to see if they have any significant pain issues, any chronic pain issues, and they also need to be evaluated to see if they have psychiatric issues.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His recommendation for a more holistic approach to the problem, which includes drugs such as Suboxone, also incorporates counseling and rehabilitation. This “full treatment” approach, he says, has a 70 percent success rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In a situation in which individuals only use the buprenorphine and none of [the other treatments], that success rate is down there less than 20 percent,” he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baxter and Alexander both caution against the notion of going “cold turkey” because it is dangerous and ineffective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In the past, it was thought that if you let somebody suffer through withdrawal that will help them never to use again because it’s such a terrible experience, but that has been shown to pretty much be folklore, and it’s not true,” said Baxter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, by including additional therapy and oversight for people dealing with pain and opioid addiction, there are viable alternatives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baxter and Alexander are both optimistic about the ways that our healthcare system is changing to deal with the opioid crisis and its intersection with pain management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alexander says that buprenorphine is “far from a panacea.” Instead, patients need to be engaged. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Frieden’s answer is even more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The prescription overdose epidemic is doctor-driven. It can be reversed, in part, by doctors’ actions,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
New research shows promise for a blood test that not only identifies cancer but also pinpoints precisely where tumors are growing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.3805.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/a&gt;, the study describes how a specific DNA signature called CpG methylation haplotypes can indicate both the presence and specific location of tumor cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senior study author Kun Zhang of the Jacobs School of Engineering at the University of California-San Diego and colleagues say their findings could offer a noninvasive method for cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the American Cancer Society, more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2017/cancer-facts-and-figures-2017.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1.6 million&lt;/a&gt; new cancer cases will be diagnosed in the United States this year and more than 600,000 people are expected to die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most cases, cancer diagnosis requires a biopsy, whereby a sample of tissue is removed and analyzed for the presence of cancer cells. This new test requires neither surgery, endoscopy, or the use of a needle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Using DNA from healthy cells&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cancer blood tests are gaining momentum for cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These tests work by identifying DNA traces of cancer cells that have broken away from tumors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At present, however, such tests are unable to provide information on where in the body a tumor is located.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Knowing the tumor's location is critical for effective early detection,&quot;&amp;nbsp;noted Zhang.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For their study, the researchers created a technique that tests for DNA signature CpG methylation haplotypes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In simple terms, this signature is an indicator of both tumor DNA and the DNA of healthy cells. The team explains that when healthy cells are destroyed by cancer cells, their DNA is released into the bloodstream. This DNA can be used to pinpoint the tissue affected by cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;We made this discovery by accident. Initially, we were taking the conventional approach and just looking for cancer cell signals and trying to find out where they were coming from,” said Zhang.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But we were also seeing signals from other cells and realized that if we integrate both sets of signals together, we could actually determine the presence or absence of a tumor, and where the tumor is growing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘A promising strategy’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To reach their findings, the researchers used samples from 10 different healthy tissues – including the liver, brain, lung, intestine, and colon – to produce a database of methylation patterns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the team used blood and tumor samples from cancer patients to create a database of genetic markers specific to cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers analyzed the blood samples of healthy patients and those with tumors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By searching for cancer- and tissue-specific genetic markers in these blood samples, the team was able to identify the presence and location of tumors.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zhang notes that further work is needed to “optimize and refine” this technique, but the researchers believe that their study provides proof of concept for a noninvasive diagnostic technique for cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In summary, methylation haplotyping in plasma is a promising strategy for the early detection of a tumor and its primary growth site, as well as for the continuous monitoring of tumor progression and metastasis to multiple organs,” say the authors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“With more plasma samples from patients at multiple clearly defined cancer stages and from healthy controls, it is possible to further improve the prediction sensitivity and specificity to a level adequate for clinical testing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/030517_severeallergyattack_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you knew that one bite of a muffin containing egg as an ingredient might kill you or your child ... how might you feel?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the day-to-day reality for many people in the United States living with severe food allergies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research shows that an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.foodallergy.org/facts-and-stats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; have food allergies that can be life-threatening. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the increase in more allergy awareness circulating these days, there is still a misconception about the reality of life after surviving a severe allergy attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply injecting someone with an EpiPen or administering Benadryl does not remedy the aftershock of an attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The aftermath&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allergic reactions vary from person to person.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most cases, after an EpiPen or other treatment has been administered, it’s important to call 911 or local emergency services and request an ambulance, and alert medical services of the details of the allergy attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the person having the attack becomes unconscious, administer CPR. It’s also crucial to head to the emergency room after a severe allergy attack even if symptoms are subsiding. There is always the potential for a follow-up allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And for many of the food allergy challenged it just doesn’t stop there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Surviving the day-to-day aftermath of a severe allergic reaction is a scary ordeal,” Roz, the mother of a severely allergic child, told Healthline. “It’s ongoing. It affects everyone in our house. Every aspect of our lives is affected by planning on how to prevent or manage a severe allergic reaction. If my son has skin contact with nut oil or sesame oil — and doesn’t even ingest it — he ends up with hives all over his body that can potentially affect his breathing. This is too much pressure for a 9-year-old.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The physical and emotional state of surviving a severe anaphylactic allergy attack can be all-encompassing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a recent Healthline online survey, participants had similar comments when speaking on the subject:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I constantly have panic attacks after,” said Jenifer Lyn Owens. “Thinking everything I eat is going to cause my throat to swell, even if I know for sure it won’t. It’s not easy to deal with.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I feel complete exhaustion and extreme fatigue after finishing post and steroids [adrenal fatigue],” added Julie Stein Giesegh. “It can take six weeks or more to fully recover my strength.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our son is 11, and he has horrible anxiety over food,” said Megan Hunter. “Since he’s gotten older and is more aware of how he feels when he has a reaction he panics. Anytime he tried something new he worries. His reaction goes from mild to severe in no time. He usually takes a day or two to feel normal again.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, many within the food allergic community share one major concern after a severe allergy attack occurs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You constantly worry about being exposed to the trigger again. I spent three days in the hospital because of an unknown allergy,” said Renee Baxter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Taking charge of the situation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite these worries many families are trying to take control where they can.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Food allergic reactions are not one-time events.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We constantly have to discuss hypothetical situations with my son so he is prepared,” Julie, the mother of a child with food allergies, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That training has come in handy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Recently, a friend at school told my son he could eat the candy that was offered and my son said, ‘No. There are no ingredients listed. I am not supposed to eat anything without asking my mom or dad,’” said Julie. “The reason he was able to say that was because just that morning we discussed a hypothetical situation like that occurring. This is part of our daily life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kristen Duncan Williams is the Founder of FAKS: Families of Allergic Kids in School. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;FAKS is an organization devoted to spreading more food allergy awareness within school communities.

er Michael Kuluva hasn’t let rheumatoid arthritis (RA) get in his way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he’s acknowledged a notable void in the fashion and beauty industries when it comes to adaptive options and more inclusive designs for people living with an illness or disability. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He isn’t alone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are online initiatives in the form of hashtags, blogs, Twitter chats, and Instagram accounts that explore the relationship between fashion and chronic illness. It can be a pain for people in pain to dress themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can also be difficult to find fashionable, stylish options that are also adaptive and functional for anyone with a disability or aching body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A fashion dream altered&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kuluva is the founder of the label Tumbler and Tipsy, which he debuted at New York Fashion Week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the former figure skater didn’t always dream of a career in fashion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After he retired from his sport in his mid-20s, Kuluva realized that he had another interest and a talent that couldn’t be ignored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He began working as an assistant for a designer despite having no formal training. He eventually secured a scholarship to the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising (FIDM). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During his time at FIDM, he found that he was performing well academically but couldn’t perform some basic tasks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I noticed I could not even draw a straight line, and I had other little setbacks. I had trouble cutting fabric and I began comparing myself to other students,” Kuluva told Healthline. “My joints just weren't doing what they should be. I had pain. Then, one day, walking from class to my car, my back suddenly gave out.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kuluva first thought he had a kidney stone. He saw a urologist who told him the issue wasn’t urological and suggested that Kuluva see a rheumatologist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After visiting three doctors and waiting months to be seen at the Mayo Clinic, Kuluva was eventually diagnosed with RA. Through trial and error, he found a combination of medications that worked pretty well for controlling his condition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No medication is ever 100 percent, but my regimen is going well,” he said. “If I miss a few weeks of treatment, because of travel or fashion shows for example, then I can definitely feel that. I didn’t really have issues while figure skating. … I had some bursitis, but I don’t think it had anything to do with my RA. So, my decision to retire from skating was not related to my rheumatoid arthritis, but I’m glad I retired when I did.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bringing awareness to Fashion Week&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After showing a collection that would eventually help to launch the career of model Kendall Jenner, Kuluva started to think about how he could use his art and his platform for good. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s been a lot of proud moments — a lot of great moments that are unforgettable. Kendall Jenner helped to launch my career and vice versa,” he said. “This gave me kind of a voice in society. So my CreakyJoints collection was a pivotal moment where I got to express myself within my fashion.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The collection is a collaboration with the arthritis-related nonprofit CreakyJoints, to promote RA awareness on the runway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CreakyJoints has worked with celebrities like actress &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/actress-megan-park-talks-about-life-with-rheumatoid-arthritis-072915&quot;&gt;Megan Park&lt;/a&gt; to promote RA awareness, but this fashion collection came about rather organically.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Real Housewife of New York Jill Zarin’s daughter was backstage in my dressing room, and we got to talking because she has a form of arthritis, too. It got me thinking, and after our conversation I figured I might contact CreakyJoints after that collection was done,” Kuluva recalled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said he just wanted to lend his voice to a cause and be an advocate for something.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I like the nonprofit mindset of CreakyJoints, all for the patients. The president, Seth, has [spondyloarthritis], and so he really gets it,” Kuluva said. “So we all had lunch and brainstormed what we could do together. They pretty much left it up to me. I came up with putting starbursts on all the joints in my SS2017 show. The starbursts, while fashionable, represent the joint pain.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kuluva said the fashion industry still has a void to fill with adaptive and inclusive fashions for people who are sick or have disabilities. This is especially in terms of shoes and footwear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kuluva did acknowledge that some current trends of more comfortable and functional styles may be ideal for people with chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for his own work, he continues to dream big and strives to do more. Kuluva has a history of incorporating charity and social change in his work as a fashion designer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was hoping to inspire change with the collection that I did. I hope that it opens eyes and spreads awareness,” Kuluva said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview for &lt;a href=&quot;https://themighty.com/2016/09/michael-kuluva-designs-activewear-line-inspired-by-arthritis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Mighty&lt;/a&gt;, Kuluva explained his CreakyJoints collection by saying, “It really shows the joints affected by arthritis. It’s an explosion of colors on joints that would light up on tests for arthritis.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being diagnosed with RA at age 28 could have destroyed his career or his vision for the future. But it didn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kuluva advises other young people diagnosed with illnesses like RA to keep looking forward and not hiding their condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As long as you're open and honest with your doctor and your family with what is going on with you and your health, you can get the help you need. An organization like CreakyJoints can help you understand that you may have restrictions, but you can still achieve great things,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Will fashion become more adaptive? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kuluva is doing his part to spread awareness and other designers are, too. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tommy Hilfiger has designed some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3681481/Tommy-Hilfiger-s-collection-adaptive-clothing-designed-children-special-needs-seller-fashion-brand.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;adaptive clothing&lt;/a&gt; for children with special needs and physical disabilities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fashion bloggers have fought back against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bustle.com/p/why-disability-is-the-latest-fashion-industry-frontier-30548&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ableism in fashion shoots&lt;/a&gt;. (Like Kylie Jenner and Lady Gaga using gilded wheelchairs as “props.”)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/madelinesmodelling_/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Madeline Stewart&lt;/a&gt; has made headlines as a model with Down syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New York Fashion Week began to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/2/25/the-disabled-models-of-new-york-fashion-week.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;models with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, including amputee &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/shahol1/?hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Shaholly Ayers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyonce cast disability activist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bustle.com/articles/149109-beyonce-casts-disabled-activist-jillian-mercado-for-an-awesomely-inclusive-campaign-photos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jillian Mercado&lt;/a&gt; as a model in one of her advertising campaigns. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.verywell.com/fashionable-adaptive-clothing-1094363&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many more brands&lt;/a&gt; are coming out with adaptive clothing that is fashionable and chic, yet still provides necessary comfort and functionality. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, many fashions don’t have stylish, easy-to-wear or adaptive alternatives, or inclusive runway shows or advertising campaigns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The beauty industry also lacks variety when it comes to ergonomic and adaptive options for hairstyling tools and makeup brushes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But designers like Kuluva think that these baby steps toward progress are working in favor of people with health problems or physical disabilities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the industry will get there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, the Arthritis Foundation has a list of approved arthritis-friendly products with the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/tools-resources/ease-of-use/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ease of Use&lt;/a&gt;” seal of approval, to help people with arthritis dress themselves more easily. They also have suggested footwear brands and options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other websites, like the now-defunct Arthriving site from Aleve, have attempted to catalog the best products to help people with arthritis pain function better when it comes to daily activities like drying their hair, cooking, buttoning a blouse, fastening a bra, or tying their shoes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While that site is gone, there are many blogs that offer tips for &lt;a href=&quot;/health-slideshow/arthritis-products&quot;&gt;living well with chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; or limitations in terms of physical mobility and ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/heart-health/030317_heartdisease_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that Americans aren’t getting the message about heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New statistics predict that 45 percent of people in the United States will have at least one issue related to the disease by 2035.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s up from earlier predictions from the American Heart Association (AHA) of 40 percent by 2030. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AHA predicts that costs related to the disease will double from $555 billion in 2016 to $1.1 trillion in 2035.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That “could bankrupt our nation’s economy and healthcare system,” according to AHA President Steven Houser, PhD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says heart disease and its complications are spreading quicker than originally thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The news comes as two celebrities made recent headlines for heart-related complications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Actor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/26/entertainment/bill-paxton-dead/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bill Paxton&lt;/a&gt; died at age 61, reportedly from a stroke during heart surgery to fix a damaged valve, while fitness guru &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/news/bob-harper-updates-fans-condition-following-heart-attack-t108790&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bob Harper&lt;/a&gt;, from “The Biggest Loser,” suffered a heart attack at age 51.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why is heart disease getting worse, even though our society seems obsessed with healthy living?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s disease garner more attention, but the fact is cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the nation’s most prevalent and costly killer, Houser told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though smoking is on the decline, Houser said that other risk factors — obesity, poor diet, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes — are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, people may not realize how devastating heart disease is until they know someone who has it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Beating a preventable disease&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Miller is a cardiology professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and author of “Heal Your Heart: The Positive Emotions Prescription to Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He told Healthline that the main factors driving the rise in heart disease are obesity and type 2 diabetes, but the real underlying culprits are moving less and stressing more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we aren't doing enough is getting up and out, spending quality time with loved ones daily, and smelling the roses,” Miller said. &quot;We also need ‘me time’ to recharge, so I tell my patients to spend at least 15 minutes by themselves to collect their thoughts, whether by meditation or shutting off the radio while in the car.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I also suggest getting up every 15 minutes if you have a desk job and move around and stretch. &amp;nbsp;Same recommendations hold while watching TV,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Regina Druz, a cardiologist at the Integrative Cardiology Center of Long Island, told Healthline that stress is a factor along with obesity, diabetes, and pollution. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The epidemic is related to several factors, all converging in what amounts to a ‘perfect storm’ situation,” she said. “However, what fuels the rise of diabetes and obesity, and heart disease down the line, is inflammation, and the impact of inflammation and environment on our genetics.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A wake-up call?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Houser was surprised when he reviewed the recent AHA report due to the rising death rates and numbers that describe the financial toll CVD will have in the United States. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report also finds that, by 2035, more than 123 million Americans will have high blood pressure, 24 million will have coronary heart disease, and more than 11 million will have experienced a stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Houser said better investments in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would reduce the burden and costs associated with heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Policymakers must invest in research and ensure Americans have affordable, quality health care—especially preventive care. Then, schools and workplaces have to create healthy environments that promote healthy habits, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fact that CVD could singlehandedly bankrupt our nation’s healthcare system is disturbing,” Houser said. “But it’s a real possibility if we don’t act soon to do a better job of preventing what are largely preventable disorders.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Can Acupuncture Cure Carpal Tunnel Pain?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/news/030217_acupuncture_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acupuncture may be more effective in treating some chronic pain ailments than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers in a study &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/brain/awx015/3058778/Rewiring-the-primary-somatosensory-cortex-in&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Brain concluded that acupuncture helped relieve pain for people with carpal tunnel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said the acupuncture helped reduce symptoms by “remapping” the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They added the therapy also provided some healing effects at the source of the pain in the patients’ wrists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vitaly Napadow, PhD, director of the Center for Integrative Pain Neuroimaging, and senior author of the research paper, said his group hopes to do more research on acupuncture’s effectiveness on carpal tunnel and other chronic pain ailments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of the benefits of acupuncture is it’s so minimally invasive and has such a low-risk profile,” Napadow told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What researchers discovered&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this study, 80 people with an average age of 49 were tested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The volunteers, 65 of whom were women, were divided into three groups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One group was treated with verum electro-acupuncture at the wrist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another group was given the acupuncture therapy in an ankle on the opposite side of their affected wrist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The third group was given “sham acupuncture” treatments as a control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They were each given 16 treatments over eight weeks. The participants were evaluated after the treatments and then reevaluated three months later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Napadow said all three groups reported some relief from pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, he said the two groups that received acupuncture also showed some physiological changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High-tech imaging revealed the acupuncture had caused some mapping changes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, there appeared to be some healing effects in participants’ wrists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The group that received treatment in their wrists showed more benefits than the people who got acupuncture in their ankles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why acupuncture is effective&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This study was not the first to show that acupuncture can be effective on carpal tunnel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted studies in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3523426/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1611-acupuncture-reverses-carpal-tunnel-syndrome&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; and reported that study participants experienced pain relief after receiving acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Napadow said his group’s study also measured the physical changes acupuncture produced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said the signals the brain receives after an acupuncture needle is stuck into the skin may in essence “remap” the brain so it modifies pain signals from the wrist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, he said, the needle punctures at the pain point may cause the body to send extra blood to that spot, much like what happens during bruising.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That additional blood may help damaged nerves to heal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There seem to be some top down effects,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Greater use of acupuncture&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Napadow said acupuncture is an alternative treatment that some people may want to consider before using drugs, or an invasive type of procedure such as surgery, for any kind of chronic pain ailment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added that acupuncture is already recommended in a number of guidelines for various chronic pain conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said the biggest barrier right now is getting insurance companies to cover these alternative treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For people who might be reluctant to try this ancient Chinese treatment, Napadow said they should consider the validity of the therapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People should focus not so much on the origin of the therapy but rather what it’s doing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
p&gt;There may be a long way to go before a new treatment for Alzheimer’s comes on the market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just three months after drug company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/health/eli-lillys-experimental-alzheimers-drug-failed-in-large-trial.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eli Lilly&lt;/a&gt; ended the clinical trial of its Alzheimer’s drug solanezumab, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/02/another-alzheimers-drug-flops-pivotal-clinical-trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Merck&lt;/a&gt; has stopped the trial of its Alzheimer’s drug verubecestat because an independent study found the drug had no chance of working. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s been a decade since a new drug was placed on pharmacy shelves to help treat the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, and there were high hopes for both the Eli Lilly and Merck drugs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The more recent failures have certainly been disappointing, both from the patient advocacy point of view, but also from the perspective of the entire research field,” Bruce Lamb, PhD, Roberts Family Chair in Alzheimer’s Disease Research, and executive director of the Stark Neuroscience Research Institute at Indiana University, told Healthline.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“However, on the flip side, we now understand a great deal more about the disease processes than we did just a few years ago, and there is general consensus that we must redouble our efforts and work to speed these efforts as much as is possible,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A growing, expensive problem&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 5 million people in the United States live with Alzheimer’s, a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking, and behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of cases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/aag/alzheimers.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;5.4 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; with Alzheimer’s it is estimated 5.2 million are 65 years of age or older. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every 66 seconds, someone in the United States develops Alzheimer’s, and this number is expected to increase significantly in the coming decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We know the numbers are going to triple by the middle of the century if we don’t find a way to stop, slow, or cure the disease,” James Hendrix, PhD, director of Global Science Initiatives at the Alzheimer’s Association, told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alz.org/facts/overview.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; from the Alzheimer’s Association shows that by 2050, the number of people 65 years of age or older with Alzheimer’s disease is projected to hit almost 14 million. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unless a medical breakthrough is discovered that can prevent or cure the disease, this will have a devastating effect on those living with the disease and the people who care for them. And it will likely have significant economic ramifications. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2016, care for those with Alzheimer’s and other dementias cost the United States &lt;a href=&quot;http://act.alz.org/site/DocServer/2012_Costs_Fact_Sheet_version_2.pdf?docID=7161&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$236 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If we don’t find a way to stop or slow the disease by the middle of the century, one third of the Medicare budget as it currently exists would go to one disease. … Alzheimer’s disease,” Hendrix said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And with &lt;a href=&quot;https://alz.org/global/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;47 million people&lt;/a&gt; worldwide affected by dementia, the economic impact will be felt on a global scale.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This disease has the potential to actually bankrupt whole health systems in some countries. It’s not just an issue of compassion for families and people who are dealing with Alzheimer’s and dementia, it’s also an urgent issue in terms of economics. … This is a very expensive disease,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alz.org/alzheimers_disease_trajectory.asp#summary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt; calculates that a successful treatment introduced in 2025 that could delay the onset of Alzheimer’s by just five years could reduce the number of people with the disease by 5.7 million by the middle of the century. This would save more than $220 billion within the first five years.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tackling the unknown&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The potential market for a new Alzheimer’s therapy would be considerable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, some experts worry that pharmaceutical companies will stop pursuing trials for Alzheimer’s drugs if their efforts continue to fail. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is certainly a risk that some of the other big players in development of Alzheimer’s therapies may not continue to develop their drug pipelines if the risk is too high,” Lamb said.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“On the flip side, there is an extremely large market for Alzheimer’s therapies, so even a relatively modest success would be transformative and potentially quite lucrative,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research, experts say there is still so much that is unknown about Alzheimer’s that producing effective therapies remains challenging. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our understanding of this very complex disease is still rudimentary at best,” Lamb said. “We still understand very little about all of the changes occurring within the brain over the 20 to 30 years’ disease course. This makes it very difficult to both identify potential targets and also know when to target these therapies over the disease course.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hendrix says although the recent failures in clinical trials are disappointing, there are still other options to pursue. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“With every trial we learn something. … And there’s a vast amount of information and data that comes out. We need a better understanding of the disease and that will lead to better care,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lamb argues that more funding for Alzheimer’s research is crucial given the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Funding for Alzheimer’s research by the federal government is not appropriately scaled given the problem,” Lamb said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says it is estimated the federal government spends more than $200 billion a year on care for Alzheimer’s patients yet only spends $950 million on Alzheimer’s research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The numbers don’t lie. We need better therapies for the millions who are dealing with the disease and the millions more who will get the disease in the coming decades,” Hendrix said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Just as justice delayed is justice denied, so, too, therapy delayed is therapy denied. That denial costs human lives, day after day.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most couples, there would be other options available, points out Marcy Darnovsky, PhD, director of the Center for Genetics and Society in California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some might be able to use an egg or sperm donor or screen embryos with preimplantation genetic diagnosis in a fertility clinic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also the question of what this research will mean not just for our health but for our perceptions of society.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If we can do away with a disease like cystic fibrosis, for instance, how will that affect how we view and treat those who still have it?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What will we be saying about who is “healthy” and who isn’t?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a way of setting a bar about what kinds of people should be born,” Darnovsky told Healthline. “There are concerns about stigmatizing conditions and reducing the social supports of people who do live with those conditions.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;When it could affect you &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All these implications are years or even decades away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research that will happen in the near term is more about improving the technology, not modifying embryos intended to be gestated and born.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That germline editing, in fact, is not allowed because of a prohibition on using federal funds to review “research in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the advisory panel’s report states that the technology is not ready for human trials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it also said using it to edit the precursors of humans — embryos, eggs, sperm — could soon be “a realistic possibility that deserves serious consideration.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, someone who is interested in one day benefiting from embryo editing should undergo carrier testing to see if and how much they are at risk of passing on a heritable disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Go through your [doctor], not one of those companies where you send off your spit in a vial,” said Darnovsky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said physicians have the time, training, and resources to make sure you’re fully informed about any conditions or decisions you’ll have to make.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, they can also keep you updated on new technologies and ethical quandaries as they emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>These Doctors Accept Only Cash</title>

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/030117_cashdoctors_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dr. Heather Bartlett was working as an outpatient doctor for a hospital system in Seattle — right out of residency — her idealism ran headlong into the reality of much primary care medicine in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Too many patients. Too little time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was a real eye-opening experience how many people you had to see,” said Bartlett, now a family medicine doctor at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theBartlettclinic.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Bartlett Medical Clinic &amp;amp; Wellness Center&lt;/a&gt;, a direct primary care practice in Ohio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To make ends meet, many primary care practices squeeze more patient visits into their week. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As they do, the length of each visit shrinks, giving doctors barely enough time to assess a patient’s main concern, let alone connect with them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Patients become herded through the cattle gates and physicians become hamsters in the wheel,” Bartlett told Healthline. “And it doesn’t make for a good relationship for anybody.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So Bartlett did what a small but increasing number of physicians are doing — ditching insurance companies altogether. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead they are setting up cash-only medical practices where doctors deal directly with patients on financial matters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This immediately shifts the doctor-patient relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The main benefit of not billing through insurance is that you no longer work for the insurance company. You work directly for the patient,” Dr. Carmela Mancini, an internal medicine doctor who has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://doctorMancini.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;direct primary care practice&lt;/a&gt; in Massachusetts told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is ‘cash only?’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cash only model is known as direct care or direct primary care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patients pay an annual or monthly fee for access to their doctor. This covers most primary care procedures — things like physicals, tests for strep throat, EKGs, and stitches. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patients also get 24/7 access to their doctors, longer office visits, and often same-day appointments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Direct primary care differs from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medicaresearchinstitute.org/news-and-events/blog/2016/02/retainer-based-medicine-right-model-care-personalization/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;concierge medicine&lt;/a&gt;, which still bills insurance but uses the membership fees to provide patients with greater access and to pay for procedures not covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.johnlocke.org/app/uploads/2016/02/DPC-Spotlight.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;John Locke Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the average monthly payment for direct primary care is $25 to $85. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some practices also offer different membership levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Mancini’s practice, the fee ranges from $30 per month for 18- to 21-year olds, to $125 per month for people 65 years or older who often need more intensive care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With only 800 to 1,000 patients — or fewer — direct primary care practices are smaller than typical primary care practices, which may have &lt;a href=&quot;http://californiahealthline.org/news/new-program-in-coachella-valley-seeks-affordability-in-personalized-primary-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2,000 to 3,000 patients&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This allows time during the day for longer office visits — and lets doctors maintain better work-life balance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Typical primary care doctors may spend no more than 10 to 15 minutes with each patient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A direct primary care doctor may spend at least 20 minutes with a patient. Or more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A follow-up visit with Mancini is 30 minutes. For people with multiple chronic conditions, she’ll book one-and-a-half hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This hearkens back to your great-grandparents’ time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is how it used to be back in the day before you had back-to-back patients,” said Bartlett, “before insurance became the norm for outpatient care around the 1950s.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Doctors connecting with patients&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Longer visits help doctors see the big picture when it comes to their patients’ health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“To do good medicine, you need to know what’s going on with somebody,” said Bartlett. “If you tell somebody, ‘I only have time to hear your top two things,’ but their third thing was chest pain, you haven’t done your job.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Direct primary care doctors also have more control over how they interact with patients. Phone consultations, text messages, and Skype are common.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most insurance companies will only reimburse a doctor when a patient comes into the office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t need to force people to come into my office for things that don’t need to be handled that way,” said Bartlett. “Telemedicine is booming. There’s a reason for that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With telemedicine, patients can avoid unnecessary trips to the doctor — and hours away from work or having to pay for a babysitter — just to find out the results of a lab test or to ask a simple question about a rash or a cold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And because doctors are accessible around-the-clock, patients may be less likely to put off seeking help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After talking to a patient on the phone or getting a text, a doctor can write a prescription, refer a patient to the emergency room, or just ease their concerns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are so many patients that have so much anxiety,” said Bartlett. “A lot of anxiety is triggered by a concern that there’s something wrong with them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Quicker care can also keep small problems from turning into larger ones — like a cat scratch becoming a major infection or symptoms of a heart attack or stroke going untreated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People get urgent care when it’s needed and avoid it when it’s not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“With three of us in the office getting to know patients, we can save so many ER visits, so many unnecessary urgent care visits,” said Dr. Jeffrey Gold, a family practice doctor at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.Golddirectcare.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gold Direct Care&lt;/a&gt;, a direct primary care practice in Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cutting out insurance companies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many advocates of direct primary care say these benefits result from no longer dealing with insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of this is that insurance companies don’t reimburse doctors enough to cover the cost of longer visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And there are many hoops for doctors to jump through to get reimbursed, including the use of electronic medical records for billing purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most of us chose primary care to build relationships with people and take care of people,” said Gold. “How do you do that in an eight-minute visit, where 75 percent of it you’re standing at a computer checking boxes and typing stuff in?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cutting out insurance billing also cuts costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“[This model] definitely is sustainable, and what makes it sustainable is my overhead is really low,” said Mancini. “When you’re not billing through insurance, you don’t need 10 people doing coding and billing for you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although direct primary care physicians have fewer patients, the monthly membership fees plus lower overhead means that their practices can still be financially viable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Direct primary care doctors can even do something else your great-grandparents might have been familiar with — the house call.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have quite a few patients that can’t get out of the house because they’re homebound for a variety of reasons,” said Mancini. “In the insurance-based model, it’s really hard to do a home visit.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Putting consumers in charge&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A big part of the direct primary care model is price transparency, which puts more control back in the hands of consumers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How do you become a consumer if you don’t have the right tools?” said Gold. “The biggest thing we’re bringing to light is transparency in pricing, which does not exist.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Practices list membership fees on their website and clearly explain what patients get for their money — no surprise bills when an insurance company says a doctor’s visit wasn’t covered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Direct primary care practices can also offer inexpensive medications to patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You can have a small wholesale pharmacy in your office and dispense noncontrolled and noncompounded medications at amazing prices,” said Bartlett.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And doctors negotiate prices with private companies for better rates on lab tests, imaging, and other medical services — some of these are even &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/4649914/why-the-doctor-takes-only-cash/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cash-only businesses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These rates are sometimes lower than what an insurance company would pay for the same service.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like their insurance-taking counterparts, direct primary care physicians can refer patients to a urologist, cardiologist, or other specialist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But because direct primary care doctors spend more time getting to know patients’ medical histories and assessing their symptoms, they may be less likely to refer to a specialist just because they are in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many patients still carry some form of health insurance to cover these visits, hospital stays, and other nonprimary care services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, even some people with insurance that covers primary care visits find it worthwhile to pay a membership fee for 24/7 access to their doctor, longer visits, and a shorter wait for an appointment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the promises made by direct primary care advocates, especially given the small amount of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medpagetoday.com/Blogs/CareerConsult/60762&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; available on these practices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2016, only 6 percent of physicians participated in a cash only practice, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/compensation/2016/public/overview#page=19&quot;&gt;Medscape's Physician Compensation Report&lt;/a&gt;. But interest is growing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-four-legs-of-a-new-health-care-system-1480550930&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/a&gt; sees direct primary care as an important piece of any replacement for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), largely because of its free market approach and focus on price transparency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Advocates say the direct primary care movement highlights the need to keep the doctor-patient relationship up front in any discussion of the future of the U.S. healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Insurance does not equate to care,” said Gold. “It’s all well and good to have Medicaid or any other subsidized health plan, but if you can’t get access to a doctor who knows you and cares about you, a lot of good that [insurance] card does.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Downsides to cash only&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While advocates of direct primary care feel strongly about the ability of this approach to produce better care for patients, there are some downsides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For doctors, switching to a direct primary care model is a big step. And like any business, they may have to invest heavily up front before their practices have enough patients to be sustainable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They may also need to spend more time on the business side of their practices — marketing their practices, negotiating prices on lab tests and radiology services and medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They may even have to educate communities about the benefits of letting go of insurance for primary care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I knew this was the right thing for me, and I knew it was the right thing for patients,” said Gold. “But I also knew that 99 percent of the patients were also going to think it was bad for them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many new primary care doctors are trained to assess quickly and refer to specialists. So they may not have a broad enough medical background to handle patient care with the intensity required for a direct primary care practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And when doctors switch to direct primary care, it can affect their current patients and their communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If current patients choose not to follow a doctor into the new direct primary care practice, they may lose a long-standing relationship with their physician.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not every community has enough primary care doctors to go around, which can be exacerbated when doctors cut their patient lists in half.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cost is also an issue. Even at the lower membership fees, not everyone will be able to pay this out-of-pocket expense, particularly those on Medicaid. Some practices offer “charity care” to those in need, but this may not meet the demand.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Qliance, a larger direct primary care business shows that this may be &lt;a href=&quot;http://californiahealthline.org/news/new-program-in-coachella-valley-seeks-affordability-in-personalized-primary-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;less of a concern&lt;/a&gt;. The company has roughly 35,000 patients, about half are enrolled in Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some doctors have raised concerns about the lack of oversight offered by insurance companies, which monitor doctors to make sure they are following clinical care guidelines and practicing evidence-based medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

think vitamin D is little more than a component in your daily multivitamin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the so-called “sunshine vitamin” is more complicated — and potentially more beneficial — than you might have imagined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s long been known that vitamin D helps bone growth and strength by increasing the body’s absorption of calcium, magnesium, iron, and other beneficial minerals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Absorbing sunlight and eating fatty fish are two simple ways to boost vitamin D levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But some of vitamin D’s unique characteristics — and its lesser-known benefits — may make it worth talking to your doctor about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A unique vitamin&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike other members of the vitamin alphabet, vitamin D defies easy classification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s because it could actually be considered a hormone, since it’s synthesized in the liver and kidneys. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another unique aspect of vitamin D is the fact that, apart from fatty fish oil, vitamin D is rarely found in food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The essential nutrient is dependent on body chemistry — and because everybody is different — it’s worth getting an expert opinion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I always measure vitamin D,” Dr. Jenny Goodman, Nutritional and Environmental Medicine specialist from the British Society for Ecological Medicine (BSEM), told Healthline. “It’s very important because you can theoretically overdose — it’s very unlikely, but still technically a risk. You could never overdose on vitamin C or the B vitamins, because they’re water-soluble and you just pee out whatever you don’t need.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any B or C vitamins will be gone from your system within a few hours, Goodman noted. But, that’s not the case with vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s why she tends to measure patients’ levels before suggesting they take it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goodman said that humans once got enough sunlight to produce sufficient vitamin D, but times have changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We all evolved from Africa, we didn’t evolve with clothes on, and we didn’t evolve indoors. So our basic natural state is to be running around under an African sun with very little covering on,” she explained. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even in the Northern Hemisphere, until the Industrial Revolution, most people worked outside all the time, and they got by.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the industrial revolution, people began spending more time indoors, in offices, and at home. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goodman said that unless you happen to have a job as a gardener or a landscape designer, you likely won’t get enough sun, even through the summer, because you’re just not outdoors enough. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People’s requirements vary, which is why levels should be measured,” she added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Old benefits, new benefits&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The link between healthy vitamin D levels and healthy bones is well-known.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But more recent research sheds light on a wider range of possible benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) found that low levels of vitamin D could &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/vitamin-d-may-help-prevent-treat-multiple-sclerosis&quot;&gt;accelerate the progression&lt;/a&gt; of multiple sclerosis (MS) for people in the early stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Getting enough vitamin D may protect against this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Recent research out of the University of Birmingham, published in PLOS ONE, suggests that increased levels of vitamin D in the blood can help &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170665&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;optimize muscle strength&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead study author, and Clinical Lecturer at the Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research at the University of Birmingham, Zaki Hassan-Smith, PhD, told Healthline in an email that researchers hope to learn more about this connection in future studies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We found that the receptor which vitamin D is known to act through was present in muscle from our research volunteers,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We also observed associations between serum vitamin D levels and a number of genes that are involved in muscle function,” he added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hassan-Smith says that his team is seeking funding for trials of vitamin D in different groups, including the elderly and high-performance athletes, in order to better understand optimum doses of vitamin D. He also points to other research into possible health benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bmj.com/content/356/bmj.i6583&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BMJ study&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that there may be benefit in [vitamin D] reducing respiratory tract infections, but the jury is still out,” he wrote. “There are large scale randomized controlled trials due to report in a number of health outcomes that should give us a clearer idea in the next two to three years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goodman says that this BMJ study, which shows a link between vitamin D levels and immune system health, could be a game-changer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our bodies are producing cancer cells all the time, but what happens is our immune system detects that there’s an alien cell and it destroys it, just as it would destroy a bacterium — and it does not work properly without vitamin D,” she said. “I see particularly low levels of vitamin D in my patients with breast cancer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She suggests that anyone who has had cancer, particularly breast cancer, should have their levels checked immediately. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goodman also suggests a link between healthy vitamin D levels and brain function, telling Healthline, “You’ve got to remember that the brain is a fatty organ ... All the nerve cells are basically coated in a myelin sheath, which is basically fat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She emphasized that people need their fat-soluble vitamins, particularly vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Get it checked&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Multivitamin supplements may promise a well-rounded nutritional regimen, but they often don’t deliver, said Goodman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I definitely do not recommend multivitamins,” she said. “Firstly, they tend to have tiny amounts of everything, and secondly, they tend to have lots of fillers and rubbish in them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some options may have too much vitamin A, and many use a cheap, synthetic form of vitamin D, called vitamin D-2, according to Goodman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D-3 is the real thing. It’s what our body makes from sunshine. Multivitamins really are a cheap substitute for eating properly,” she added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that the body cannot create vitamin D if it doesn’t have the necessary components to do so. “One of the causes of vitamin D deficiency, especially in women, is low-fat diets,” said Goodman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who don’t have enough fat in their diets won’t get enough vitamin D because it’s a fat-soluble vitamin, she explained&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Goodman closed with this advice for keeping your vitamin D levels up during the winter months: “Eat oily fish — that is, salmon, trout, mackerel, sardines, and so on — through the winter, make sure you’re getting as much sunshine exposure as you can, and if you’re poorly, get your vitamin D levels tested.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/cancer/030117_bloodchip_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring cancer patients and assessing their response to treatment can sometimes involve invasive procedures, including surgery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new experimental technique may help change that. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center&amp;nbsp;and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), are using a small device to help predict which cancers are likely to spread. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experimental device is about the size of a postage stamp. The NanoVelcro Chip has nanowires 1,000 times thinner than a human hair. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chip is coated with proteins that recognize circulating tumor cells. These are cells that have broken off from tumors and entered the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From there, cancer cells can travel throughout the body and spread to other tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers run the blood sample through the chip. The proteins recognize and capture circulating tumor cells, which can then be identified and analyzed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a technique that could make monitoring cancer treatment easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s far better to draw a tube of blood once a month to monitor cancer than to make patients undergo repeated surgical procedures,”&amp;nbsp;Dr. Edwin Posadas said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/About-Us/News/News-Releases-2017/Cedars-Sinai-UCLA-Scientists-Use-New-Blood-Biopsies-With-Experimental-Device-to-Speed-Cancer-Diagnosis-and-Predict-Disease-Spread.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Posadas is medical director of the Urologic Oncology Program at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Patients/Programs-and-Services/Cancer-Institute/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cedars-Sinai Samuel Oschin Comprehensive Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the lead investigators of the research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The power of this technology lies in its capacity to provide information that is equal to, or even superior to, traditional tumor sampling by invasive procedures,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Blood biopsies for prostate cancer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research focused on prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s an important area of study because prostate cancer can be slow growing or super aggressive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Slow-growing types may never become an issue and don’t necessarily need treatment. Other types spread quickly and are potentially fatal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in men in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knowing the difference as early as possible can save many men from treatment they don’t need. For others, it means getting the most effective treatment as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This research showed that some cancer cells contain a smaller nucleus than others. Men with the most aggressive type of prostate cancer have cells with these small nuclei. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists found that the smaller nuclei are associated with cancer spreading to the liver and lungs. And it happened before the metastases were found.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a discovery that could help identify those patients who are at high risk of metastatic prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Circulating tumor technology &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liquid biopsies have been around for some time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So has the concept of circulating tumor cells, according to urologist Dr. Timothy Wilson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All solid tumors release circulation tumor cells. Some science suggests even early cancer, or small cancers, release cells into the bloodstream,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wilson is director of the Urologic Oncology Research Program, and professor and chair of urology at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://california.providence.org/john-wayne/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;John Wayne Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wilson said that for men with a metastatic prostate cancer, who have a high tumor burden, the biopsies are a valuable tool for tracking how well treatment is working.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Getting the tissue for a tumor biopsy involves an invasive procedure, which often means surgery. The location of the tumor and health status of the patient can sometimes make that risky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liquid biopsies are convenient and noninvasive, so they’re easier on patients. And they help doctors choose the treatments with the most potential to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Right now, blood biopsies are not used to detect, but to monitor mostly metastatic cancers. If you’re not getting a good response to treatment, and there’s an increase in cancer cells, you can switch gears and try another treatment,” said Wilson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Blood biopsies as a screening tool&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When doctors want to know if suspicious tissue is cancerous, they generally perform a biopsy of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a tissue biopsy could be replaced with a blood biopsy, it could usher in a new age of diagnosis and treatment for cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re not there yet, but Wilson has high hopes for the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The value is exciting if we have good detection for finding evidence in cancer in the bloodstream,” he said. “It would have a huge impact. Imagine what it would mean for screening.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wilson said that current screening and monitoring tests are relatively ineffective in finding small amounts of cancer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finding cancer in its early phase through these new modalities could eliminate the need for all these other tests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Theoretically, a blood sample could tell you if you’re cancer free or not. Then you could isolate and identify circulation tumor cells and analyze the DNA to learn where it came from (prostate, breast, etc.). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s where the science is going, but we’re several years away from that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would amount to a lot less testing and big cost savings, said Wilson.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He believes the small chip used by the Cedars-Sinai/UCLA researchers adds to the field of precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wilson said one of the important next steps will be increasing the likelihood of finding smaller numbers of cancer cells when the concentration is less.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is the wave of the future. Over time, it will get us away from looking at these cancers by the organ from which they came. We’ll be more precise in delivering treatment based on the characteristics of the cancer found as a result of liquid biopsy. We’ll be able to spare more radical surgery, treat earlier, and prevent more aggressive therapies and side effects,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Posadas and the other lead investigator, Hsian-Rong Tseng, PhD, professor at the Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://medschool.ucla.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Geffen School of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; at UCLA, are now part of the Blood Profiling Atlas in Cancer (BloodPAC) Project, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Cancer Moonshot program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Program participants will share data collected from circulating tumor cells. Posadas and Tseng have been collecting samples from circulating tumor cells for five years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hope is that the research will lead to effective, targeted treatments for many types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/022717_teensuicide_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suicide is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/injury/images/lc-charts/leading_causes_of_death_age_group_2014_1050w760h.gif&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;second leading cause of death&lt;/a&gt; for people between the ages of 15 and 24 in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, adolescents who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender are at even greater risk of self-harm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;National &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/results.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;data from 2015&lt;/a&gt; compiled by the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) reveal that more than 29 percent of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender high school students reported attempting suicide in the previous 12 months. That compared with only 6 percent of heterosexual students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there’s hope, at least on one horizon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2604258?utm_source=Silverchair_Information_Systems&amp;amp;utm_campaign=FTM_02162017&amp;amp;utm_content=news_rele&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Pediatrics, same-sex marriage legalization leads to an overall decrease in adolescent suicide attempts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What the study concluded&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers used YRBSS data from 1999 through 2015 of more than 750,000 students to identify how suicide statistics in states that legalized gay marriage compared with those that didn’t. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“After same-sex marriage laws were implemented,” the researchers wrote, “the proportion of high school students reporting suicide attempts in the past year decreased by 0.6 percentage points, equivalent to a 7 percent decline.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adolescents who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender had an even more precipitous drop in reported suicide attempts of 4 percentage points. That was equivalent to a 14 percent decline compared with heterosexual students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study estimates that, following this trend, “same-sex marriage policies would be associated with more than 134,000 fewer adolescents attempting suicide” every year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Julia Raifman, ScD, the study’s lead author, and a postdoctoral fellow at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told Healthline that they believe that same-sex marriage policies may have effectively reduced stigma toward LGBTQ youth by peers, teachers, and parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stigma based on sexual orientation can broadly mean an array of behaviors, but tends to include labeling, prejudice, and stereotyping. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can have a whole range of negative effects on LGBTQ individuals, including distress, anxiety, depression, and increased suicide risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The correlation between same-sex marriage legalization and reduced suicide attempts in adolescents isn’t crystal clear, but study authors say it does make a compelling argument for the benefits of such legislation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Raifman explains that studies can also offer insights into other facets of public health concerning the LGBTQ community, including how gay marriage policies affect disparities in HIV among men who have sex with men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The study’s importance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;LGBTQ rights advocates say the study is incredibly important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Suicide is a public health issue. This piece of research is a very positive tool in our toolkit that will support future efforts to link the legislation of positive regard and equality to the improvement of the lives and health of LGBTQ people,” said David W. Bond, vice president of programs at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thetrevorproject.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Trevor Project&lt;/a&gt;, a nationwide crisis intervention and suicide prevention service for LGBTQ youth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also echoes Raifman’s conclusion about the results of the research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Marriage equality can likely be seen as an indicator of acceptance, replacing the rejection that very significantly contributes to suicidality,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Same-sex marriage in the United States has been legal on a federal level since 2015. In the landmark case &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Obergefell v. Hodges&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Court voted in a 5-4 decision that same-sex couples had the fundamental right to marry and required all states to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the issue remains contentious. With a Republican administration in office, the question of LGBTQ — particularly transgender rights — has become more visible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This week, President Trump reversed an initiative set forth under President Obama that allowed students in public schools to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/us/gavin-grimm-transgender-rights-bathroom.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;use bathrooms of their choice&lt;/a&gt; — not based on their sex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, North Carolina’s now infamous “bathroom bill,” which also designates bathrooms only be used by people based on their “biological sex,” is still &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article134476919.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;being debated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Numerous outlets reported a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article72879582.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dramatic spike in calls&lt;/a&gt; to transgender suicide hotlines, following the passing of the bill in March 2016.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Janson Wu, executive director of GLAD, a legal advocacy group for the LGBTQ community, says that directives like this can be harmful, particularly to adolescents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When we ask lawmakers to pass a law, we not only explain why it is necessary to fix a concrete problem, such as discrimination,” he told Healthline, “we also impress upon them the critical importance of sending a message of inclusion and support to young people.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wu also stressed the importance of the recent research, saying that it underscores the “impact of laws that protect and affirm the equality [and] dignity of LGBT people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

t;p&gt;Scott Lagasse Jr. admits he wasn’t the kind of guy who went in for regular checkups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don’t do doctors very well,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the reason the NASCAR driver is still alive today is because of a visit to his physician in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was a day out of my life that saved my life,” Lagasse told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Florida native had gone in because he felt pain in his lower abdominal area while bicycling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His doctor told him he had colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately for Lagasse, it was stage 1, and it was caught early enough that he only needed surgery to fix what could have been a life-threatening problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was 100 percent lucky. I’m normally a very stubborn person,” Lagasse said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The race car driver also doesn’t usually talk about his personal life, but he is making an exception in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He plans to speak out during &lt;a href=&quot;https://healthfinder.gov/nho/MarchToolkit.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month&lt;/a&gt; in March.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 35-year-old husband and father is hoping to convince other people in his age group to get screened for a disease that is becoming more common in his generation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Incidence in millennials, Generation Xers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A report published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute states that people born in 1990 have double the risk of colon cancer compared with people born in 1950.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That younger age group also has quadruple the risk of rectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, 3 in 10 rectal cancer cases in this country are now in people younger than 55.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, led by American Cancer Society scientists, reports that colon cancer incidence rates increased between 1 percent and 2 percent per year from the mid-1980s until 2013 in adults 20 to 39 years of age. That compares with 0.5 percent to 1 percent per year for people from 40 to 54 years of age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For rectal cancer, the incidence rate has been rising about 3 percent a year for the past three to four decades for adults ages 20 to 39. That compares with 2 percent a year the past two decades for people 40 to 54.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study authors note that the biggest difference between the younger and older age groups is screening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people start getting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/screening/guidelines.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;screened for colorectal cancer&lt;/a&gt; at age 50.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study authors say that minimum screening age may need to be reconsidered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our finding that colorectal cancer risk for millennials has escalated back to the level of those born in the late 1800s is very sobering,” Rebecca Siegel, MPH, director of surveillance information for the American Cancer Society, said in a statement. “Educational campaigns are needed to alert clinicians and the general public about this increase to help reduce delays in diagnosis, which are so prevalent in young people, but also to encourage healthier eating and more active lifestyles to try to reverse this trend.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Getting the word out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anjelica Davis, president of Fight Colorectal Cancer &lt;a href=&quot;http://fightcolorectalcancer.org/&quot;&gt;(Fight CRC)&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline her organization is getting the word out on screening during this awareness month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said people should get a checkup and use whatever screening exam they are most comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t want you to not get tested,” she said. “The take-home tests are an option. Do the right test for you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Davis said people should consider getting screened before age 50 if they have a family history of colorectal cancer or if they experience rectal bleeding or pain in the lower abdominal area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t ignore these symptoms,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Davis noted that colorectal cancer has a 90 percent cure rate if it is caught early. She said 60 percent of the annual &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/statistics/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;50,000 cancer-related deaths&lt;/a&gt; in the United States caused by colorectal cancer could be prevented if people go in for regular screenings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Screening is a lot easier than managing a treatment schedule,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lagasse knows this all too well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He had no family history of colon cancer, but he went in when he developed pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lagasse said the fact his wife was pregnant at that time was a primary reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That started to weigh on me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first, Lagasse kept his diagnosis and treatment secret.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then one of his cousins called and talked to him about his screening because he was experiencing pain. It turned out his cousin did not have cancer, but he did go in and get checked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I came to the realization that this was a lot more important than just me,” said Lagasse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t do the doctor routine before,” he added. “I felt like it wasn’t the manly thing to do. I had this invincible mentality.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That has all changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lagasse now goes in for screening every year. So far, there’s no sign of the cancer coming back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
gt;Bonnie Makkinjie, a teacher from Florida, was diagnosed last year with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was told she’d need surgery as soon as possible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, she said, in 2014 she signed up for healthcare coverage through the ACA health insurance marketplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Obamacare absolutely saved my life,” Makkinjie, 51, a mother and grandmother who teaches art to children with autism and other developmental disabilities, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“None of my previous jobs offered insurance, and the premiums and deductibles were just too high to make it feasible,” she said. “I was fortunate to fall into the right income bracket for ACA insurance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if the ACA is repealed, Makkinjie fears she may soon be without health insurance once again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ll need future MRIs and scans to be sure the cancer has not returned,” she said. “I doubt I’ll be able to afford them without affordable insurance. It’s a scary thought.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘I’m a dead woman walking’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tina Camino Smith, a small business owner from Ohio, who’s been battling MALT lymphoma for nearly a decade, has the same fears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Without the Affordable Care Act, I’m a dead woman walking,” said Smith, who was also diagnosed last year with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), which, most experts agree, is a form of blood and bone marrow cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the ACA is repealed and there isn’t an adequate replacement, Smith told Healthline she will forego treatment and “pursue doctor-assisted suicide, when the time comes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I cannot add the financial burden to an already difficult time to my family. Both my therapist and husband understand this,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Obamacare repeal &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump and members of Congress continue to discuss the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/gops-new-plan-to-repeal-obamacare-dare-fellow-republicans-to-block-effort-1488154291&quot;&gt;possible repeal&lt;/a&gt; of the ACA, which was signed into law in March 2010.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the anxiety and anger is palpable among people with cancer and cancer survivors who have insurance because of Obamacare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tony Glavan, 60, a retired analysis technician from Minnesota, went through several clinical trials before going into lasting remission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He purchased health insurance through the ACA after he retired. The policy gave him the peace of mind that, even if his cancer recurs, he is covered. But now he doesn’t know what to think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If my cancer comes back, what does the insurance market hold for me?” he told Healthline. “Will I be allowed to participate in clinical trials as easily as I did before?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glavan said the Republicans want to “cherry pick the good parts about ACA, but I don’t think they have any idea how that will be economically feasible if they don’t force the healthy younger people to buy insurance.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Is Obamacare a disaster?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scrapping the healthcare law was one of the primary tenets of Trump’s campaign.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While supporters agree the ACA is not perfect, they note it provides multiple positive provisions and benefits and have added more than 20 million Americans to the ranks of the insured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The President continues to call it a “disaster,” and the most conservative members of Congress agree the law should be gutted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But there is growing dissent in the GOP ranks over repealing Obamacare. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During an interview Sunday on CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich, who had just met with Trump in the White House on Friday, said the hard-line conservatives in his party want to get rid of the entire healthcare law, “and that’s not acceptable.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Putting people over party, Kasich said he would “stand up” for the folks who will lose coverage if they don't get this right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What's at stake here are 20 million Americans,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former House Speaker John Boehner also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/john-boehner-obamacare-republicans-235303&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said last week&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn't believe Republican legislators will repeal the law, Politico reported. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;People with cancer speaking out&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At town hall meetings even in red states such as Arkansas and Georgia, members of Congress are being met with hostile crowds, including many people with cancer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/12/politics/audience-member-paul-ryan-town-hall-obamacare/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt; with House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin a few weeks ago, Jeff Jeans, a cancer survivor, and “lifelong Republican” from Arizona, told Ryan that President Obama saved his life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, I’m standing here today alive,” said Jeans, a small business owner who worked on the Reagan and Bush campaigns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was told at age 49 that he had cancer and had just six weeks to live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I rely on the Affordable Care Act to be able to purchase my own insurance,” he said. “Why would you repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ryan responded, “Oh, we wouldn’t do that. We want to replace it with something better.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Approval ratings&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The popularity of the ACA nationwide is in fact ascending to new heights, just as Trump’s approval rating sinks to new lows. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/23/support-for-2010-health-care-law-reaches-new-high/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;national Pew Research Center survey&lt;/a&gt; released last week, public support for Obamacare has reached its highest level on record, with 54 percent approving and 43 percent disapproving. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2432&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new poll from Quinnipiac&lt;/a&gt; found 54 percent oppose the repeal of Obamacare, while 43 percent support it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2431&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another Quinnipiac poll&lt;/a&gt; last week found Trump’s approval rating at just 38 percent, while a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-immigration-is-most-important-problem-for-trump-and-congress/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CBS News poll&lt;/a&gt; last week had the president’s approval rating at 39 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Trump voters who want Obamacare&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kathy Watson, a Trump voter and cancer survivor from Lake City, Fla., told the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-obamacare-trump-voter-20170224-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/a&gt; last week that she would have “lost everything” without Obamacare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watson said she didn’t think Trump would follow through on his promise to get rid of the ACA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ll give it a little more time,” she said, “but I’m not really sure about Trump anymore.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Watson’s story is not unique. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To the surprise of even some politicians, a significant crop of Trump voters across the nation want to keep their Obamacare and their Obamacare-backed Medicaid expansion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While some Trump voters who have Obamacare complain that it’s too expensive and too complicated, evidently few people who have it want to lose it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Grant County, Neb., Trump received more than 93 percent of the vote. But Grant also happens to be the county with the nation’s highest percentage of Obamacare enrollees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One in three Grant County residents, or 33 percent of the under-65 population, bought insurance on Obamacare exchanges, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/24/health/nebraska-trump-obamacare-aca-eprise/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CNN report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Whitley County, Ky., where 82 percent of voters supported Trump in the presidential election, the uninsured rate has dropped from 25 percent in 2013 to 10 percent today because of Obamacare, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/12/13/13848794/kentucky-obamacare-trump&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vox reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new survey by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/listening-to-trump-voters-with-aca-coverage-what-they-want-in-a-health-care-plan/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;/a&gt; asked Trump voters who relied on Obamacare or Obamacare-backed Medicaid why they voted for Trump.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The answers varied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some were simply not aware that their coverage through Medicaid expansion was the result of the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others said they signed up for Obamacare because it was the best option available but were hoping Trump would reduce the costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;People with cancer play the waiting game&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people with cancer and cancer survivors nationwide, of all political persuasions, continue to watch the news and wait. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Healthline interviews with more than two dozen people with cancer who are insured through Obamacare, the three most popular provisions in the law that they said any replacement plan should include are:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;the guarantee that coverage not be denied to people with preexisting conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the assurance that the lifetime dollar amount of an insurer’s coverage cannot be limited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the provision that it pays for preventative care such as mammograms, colonoscopies, and other tests &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lisa Swanson, 58, a graphic designer from New Hampshire, wonders what the future has in store for her and her fellow cancer survivors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Swanson had a rare type of tumor called a pheochromocytoma on her right adrenal gland. She had the tumor surgically removed, along with the adrenal gland, in 2013. She now has insurance thanks to the ACA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if the law is repealed, she may lose coverage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I dread finding out what the Republicans will decide is ‘good enough’ for those of us with preexisting conditions,” she said. “I’ve done everything I can to stay healthy. Now I just have to trust that the Republican Party will not pull the rug out from under my life.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Repeal would hit Hispanic-Americans hard &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nation’s Hispanic cancer patient community is among the most vulnerable to a repeal or replacement of Obamacare, according to healthcare and insurance industry experts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services reports that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/17/obamacare-brings-record-low-for-us-health-uninsured-rate.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;uninsured rate among Hispanics&lt;/a&gt; has dropped by more than 25 percent since 2010, in large part because of the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Glenn Llopis of Healthy Hispanic Living, the first online preventive care educational platform targeted to U.S. Hispanics, told Healthline that prior to the ACA’s demands for patient satisfaction, there was no incentive for Hispanics to pay attention to their health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hispanics do not always feel welcomed by the healthcare industry, they tend to associate doctors with hospitals and hospitals with a place to die, not get better.” said Llopis, who is author of the new book, “The Innovation Mentality.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many first-generation Hispanics would rather have a major surgical procedure performed in their native countries than in the United States, Llopis said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added that Hispanics are “often not proactive with their preventive care and thus disproportionately experience major health problems later in their lives. Without the ACA incentive, the threat to the U.S. economy and impact on global competitiveness will be catastrophic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exact national figures for Hispanic patients are not available, but, Llopis noted, “You don’t need to be a statistician to realize that if the Hispanic population increased by 243 percent between the 1980 and 2010 censuses, the number of Hispanic patients nationwide has only grown.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;‘The president is used to his lifestyle’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amelia Tena, 56, a Hispanic-American from Southern California, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 and signed up for the ACA last month. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was laid off from work last year and ended up with COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985), which she could not afford. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I don't know what kind of plan will be next, or if I will even be able to have health coverage,” she told Healthline. “My concerns are stressing me out. How will it be for cancer patients? Right now my copay is $75, and for me this is already high.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tena doesn’t believe Trump or Congress have a plan that will help her the way the ACA has.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the president is used to his lifestyle,” she said. “He's not thinking of the middle-class population. In reality, he wants to get all Mexicans out of the U.S.A.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;City of Hope offering advice&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mayra Serrano is the manager of the Center of Community Alliance for Research &amp;amp; Education (CCARE) at the City of Hope, a comprehensive cancer center in the Los Angeles area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said Obamacare’s provisions — including its preventative medicine provisions — have demonstrably improved the lives of Hispanic people with cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the ACA, Serrano said, is that it typically pays for screenings, scans, mammograms, Pap smears, colonoscopies, and other things people with cancer need but often can’t afford when there is a copay, or when they have no insurance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For people making minimum wage, $20 is a lot of money. It could come down to a choice between food and medicine,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If there is a repeal, Serrano said it is most likely that many Hispanic-Americans with lower incomes will no longer get screenings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colon cancer, cervical cancer, and other cancer diagnoses will then rise in these populations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A repeal could push public health back decades,” said Serrano.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She notes there is great fear in the Hispanic community over what Trump will do for Hispanics who signed up for Obamacare because many are in “mixed families” — meaning that some members of a family are undocumented while others are not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Serrano remains cautiously optimistic that Obamacare will be saved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cancer patients and others are telling their stories now, across the country,” she said. “It is making me more optimistic that it will not be repealed. But at this point, we just don’t know what will happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marijuana is legal in some states, but it may be harmful to children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the message delivered in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aappublications.org/news/2017/02/27/Marijuana022717&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released today by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The organization urged doctors to warn parents that the drug may be harmful to children, even though it might seem acceptable, safe, and therapeutic. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Marijuana is not a benign drug, especially for teens. Their brains are still developing, and marijuana can cause abnormal and unhealthy changes,” Dr. Seth D. Ammerman, FAAP, co-author of the AAP report, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it stands, 29 states have legalized some form of marijuana use. Eight states, along with the District of Columbia, have made recreational marijuana legal for adults over the age of 21. The other states have legalized medical marijuana. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young people using marijuana regularly can experience decreased sensory awareness, weakened motor skill control and memory function, and impaired lung function. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The drug is also tied to mental disorders including psychosis, depression, and addiction, the AAP report states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Specific concerns&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much of the concern about marijuana’s harmfulness is due to the increase in the concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is a psychoactive substance in the plant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, the amount of THC found in marijuana surged from 4 percent in 1995, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(16)00045-7/fulltext&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12 percent in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Some strains have as much as 20 percent THC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This chemical is the same one that can lower pain and ease chemotherapy side effects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP is urging doctors to talk about using marijuana as well as screening kids for substance abuse. Parents who use it may not know about the impacts it can have on children, they say. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Seeing parents use marijuana makes kids more likely to use it themselves, whether or not their parents tell them not to, because actions speak louder than words,” Dr. Sheryl A. Ryan, lead author of the report, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How kids perceive marijuana&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2015, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.samhsa.gov/data/hlcmsresource/NSDUH-FFR1-2015/NSDUH-FFR1-2015/NSDUH-FFR1-2015.htm#illicit02&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7 percent&lt;/a&gt; of children aged 12 to 17 used marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The percentage of adolescent marijuana users was similar to percentages between 2004 and 2014. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that 9 percent of people who try marijuana become addicted to it. That number rises to 17 percent when the user starts during adolescence. It goes up to 50 percent among teens that consume marijuana on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Correlating usage to confirm whether or not there has been an increase in use after a state legalizes the drug is where experts seem to disagree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP cited a National Survey on Drug Use and Health report that found the percentage of 12- to 17-year-olds who said there was a great risk to using marijuana decreased from 55 percent in 2007 to 41 percent in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/ss/ss6511a1.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; of National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data states that the percentage of kids 12 to 17 who perceived the greatest risk from using it declined from 34 percent in 2006 to 24 percent in 2013.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More legalization, more use?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Natalie Lyla Ginsberg, the policy and advocacy manager of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), told Healthline that she was disappointed in the AAP’s “alarmist warning and avoidance of research.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ginsberg cited a National Academy of Medicine &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nap.edu/catalog/24625/the-health-effects-of-cannabis-and-cannabinoids-the-current-state&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that found heavy cannabis use among 12- to 17-year-olds was at 7 percent. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24223560&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt; mentioned in that report states that users were declining compared with older adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/ss/ss6511a1.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016 CDC report&lt;/a&gt; stated that that cannabis use has declined among 12- to 17-year-olds since 2002. The report cites that kids 12 to 17 who used marijuana in the past month went up from 6.7 percent in 2006 to 7.1 percent in 2013. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ginsberg noted that Colorado’s data indicates that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/colorado-s-teen-marijuana-usage-dips-after-legalization/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;teen marijuana use&lt;/a&gt; went down in the state since legalization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kyle Sherman, chief executive officer of the point-of-sale tool Flowhub, told Healthline that his platform is geared at keeping minors out of dispensaries. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Here in Colorado we've seen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/colorado-s-teen-marijuana-usage-dips-after-legalization/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no increase&lt;/a&gt; in teen use since legalization,” Sherman said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He believes regulating cannabis will help get it off the streets and out of children’s hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is no convincing evidence that cannabis use alone is harmful for children, but we also do not have enough research to assert that that means it is therefore safe,” Ginsberg added. “However, we do have research that medical cannabis is far safer than many less effective and more dangerous pharmaceuticals often prescribed for children.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She also noted that many of the AAP’s assertions about health impacts of marijuana on children do not take into account the whole picture. The AAP should focus screening on trauma and other stressors to children, instead of solely focusing on symptoms of trauma such as substance abuse, Ginsberg said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Guohua Li, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, said the AAP’s concerns and warning are justified. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As a parent, I'm grateful to AAP for safeguarding the safety, health, and well-being of our children,” Li told Healthline. “There is an urgent need for federal, state, and local government agencies to monitor marijuana use and related consequences in children.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Li notes that the jury is still out as to whether legalization has caused an increase in marijuana use among kids, but there is mounting evidence that access to edibles has increased in children. A 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2534480&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Pediatrics&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found an increase in children being exposed to the drug in Colorado, where edibles are legal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Marcus Bachhuber, an assistant professor of medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, said that because legalization is a reality, it’s time to focus on how to regulate marijuana programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How best can we allow access for patients who could benefit while protecting kids and promoting public health?” he told Healthline. “Physicians have a key role to play in shaping policy and the overall debate, but all too often, we have decided to watch from the sidelines.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAP’s report comes about a week after President Donald Trump’s press secretary &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-threat-recreational-marijuana-industry-colorado/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sean Spicer&lt;/a&gt; spoke about cracking down on marijuana regulations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the president has said he approves of medicinal uses, federal laws still consider marijuana use to be illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/022717_randytravis_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a few minutes, it seemed like it was the last night of country western singer Randy Travis’ life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Suffocating from his fluid-filled lungs while his heart was failing, Travis flatlined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was put on life support and into an induced coma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he was conscious again, doctors found that sometime between dying and waking he suffered a stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His wife was told he probably wouldn’t survive and if he did he’d be bedridden as well as in and out of hospitals for what was left of his life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Honey, you have to let me know you want to keep fighting,” Mary said at his bedside.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She saw a tear slide down his face and he squeezed her hand. She knew then that Randy would battle back. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He and God had other plans,” she said. “His faith got him through what he got through. When a lot of people gave up on him he didn’t give up on himself.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Long road back&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now Travis, 57, is on a marathon road to recovery that has lasted nearly four years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He struggled to relearn how to walk and to partially regain use of the right side of his body. The blood clot had lodged in the part of his brain that controls those muscles and dominates the use of language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The words he’d strung into song — resulting in 25 million records sold, 22 number one hits, and eight Grammy Awards — no longer can make it from his brain to his lips because of a disorder called aphasia. It’s caused by brain trauma and it makes using words a struggle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If he could just talk to me one more time and tell me the stories that must be going through his mind,” said Mary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Travis understands what he hears, his own voice has been more difficult to find. Usually he speaks singular words or a simple “yup” and “nope.” He is skilled enough with one-word conversations that he can tell jokes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The disorder also impacts the written word, although just recently, he read “Nashville” off a road sign as he and his wife drove into town for a tribute concert in his honor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Music has come back to him more easily.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While he can’t strum the notes on his guitar with his weaker right hand, the music is so ingrained in him that Travis can chord every song on his guitar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And although he can’t speak in a full sentence, he can mouth every single word to thousands of songs. “Amazing Grace” has become his personal anthem, and he can sing those verses despite the aphasia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Travis sang it publicly for the first time in October when he accepted his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame, stunning the audience and his fellow artists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Surviving infections, surgery&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That evening was a bright moment among many struggles since that fateful day on July 7, 2013.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Travis’ fight to survive included three tracheotomies, collapsed lungs, numerous intubations and IVs until his veins collapsed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was fed through a tube and dropped to less than 100 pounds. He had emergency brain surgery. Half of his scalp was removed and stored in his abdomen to keep the skin alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And there were infections, including staph, pseudomonas, serratia, and three bouts of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It was just one thing after another that you never thought you’d live through or learn about,” said Mary. “It was a crash course for me. We were going through life at 100 miles per hour and hit a brick wall.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Travis was listed for a heart transplant, but his heart healed “by the grace of God,” Mary said. Doctors told the couple that it had likely failed because of a virus that caused&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2770911/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dilated cardiomyopathy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Piecing together how that could have happened, the doctors told Mary that it likely&amp;nbsp;occurred during filming of the movie “Christmas on the Bayou” a few weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Travis had filmed during hot, humid days in an old feed store in Opelousas, La., possibly breathing in molds and spores.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With his heart back, Travis did rehabilitation more than four hours a day in a blur of setbacks and successes. A fear of immediate death was replaced by a fear of a slower one over the six months he spent in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Giant baby steps” punctuated his recovery, said Mary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Raising awareness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, Travis is taking a break from the relentlessness of therapy and is spending his days at his ranch with his wife, dogs, horses, and cattle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He and Mary attend fellow artists’ concerts so he can hear the music he loves and encourage&amp;nbsp;his contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s also now using his energy and fame for raising awareness and money for stroke research. He’s “passing out hope” by showing what is possible to other stroke patients, said Mary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s appeared before Tennessee legislators and at a recent tribute concert in Nashville given in his honor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And on Mar. 25, Travis will make a guest appearance at a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://attstadium.com/events/beauty-kind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BeautyKind Unites Concert for a Cause&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at AT&amp;amp;T Stadium near Dallas, where the Cowboys play. The event will help raise money for the American Heart Association, River Ranch Randy Travis Fund, and other charitable organizations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Travis, who once was given no hope and no chance of survival, wants people to know that there is still life after stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point is to show “stroke victims they don’t have to be victims,” said Mary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/after-flatlining-and-years-of-therapy-country-music-star-randy-travis-is-passing-out-hope/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;original story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was published on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Heart Association News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/022417_fakenews_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The political arena isn’t the only place where “fake news” is being debated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists are now speaking out about false information and “alternative facts” that they say are diluting and harming legitimate research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be sure, there has always been phony scientific material from snake oil salesmen to industry-sponsored research to tabloid headlines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, experts interviewed by Healthline say the advent of the internet and the popularity of social media have made it easier for fraudulent information to spread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The topic is worrisome enough that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaas.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)&lt;/a&gt; made it part of their agenda at their annual meeting last weekend in Boston.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The new media environment has allowed this type of information to be disseminated,” Dominique Brossard, PhD, a life sciences communication professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who spoke at the conference, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Types of bad information&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several packages in which false information is delivered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some are simply outright lies promulgated by people with an agenda.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others are part of research funded by industry to skew results and opinions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet another segment is questionable research that receives widespread attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some are a combination of these factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the best examples from the past is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/welcome/features/20071114_cardio-tobacco/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tobacco industry&lt;/a&gt;, which for decades funded research that cast doubt on whether cigarette smoking and secondhand smoke were bad for your health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/health/sugar/big-fat-lies-sugar-propaganda&quot;&gt;sugar industry&lt;/a&gt; has also been accused of propping up studies that downplayed the health hazards of consuming sweetened foods and beverages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All an industry needs to do is create some uncertainty,” Kevin Elliott, PhD, an associate professor at Michigan State University, who also spoke at the AAAS meeting, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the tainted research isn’t easy to spot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/aivt.2016.0024&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was released that concluded lung inflammation was far less serious in e-cigarette smokers than it was in people who smoked regular cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research was funded by British American Tobacco.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why would this organization fund a study that had negative results for regular cigarettes? Turns out the &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/tobacco-companies-taking-over-e-cigarette&quot;&gt;tobacco industry worldwide&lt;/a&gt; is getting into the e-cigarette market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Faulty research can also receive widespread attention.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 1998, a British doctor named Andrew Wakefield published a study in The Lancet that linked autism to the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, that study only included a small sample size of 12 individuals, and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;number of conflicts&lt;/a&gt; were eventually uncovered involving Wakefield and his colleagues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Lancet retracted the study in 2010, but it still is quoted by some anti-vaccination organizations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In September 2012, a study was widely publicized that linked genetically modified corn and the herbicide Roundup to tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study was retracted in 2013 but then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-on-genetically-modified-corn-herbicide-and-tumors-reignites-controversy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;republished in another journal&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brossard said these types of studies have led to the creation of a blog called &lt;a href=&quot;http://retractionwatch.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Retraction Watch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said the online column reports on 500 to 600 retractions a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Spreading the word&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem isn’t just the questionable research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s also how quickly and widely the information can spread.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elliott and Brossard note that anyone can have a website in today’s world, and even former Playboy playmates like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/11-things-that-jenny-mccarthy-has-said-about-vaccines?utm_term=.tbzMbe2Ao#.nrw9j6QbG&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jenny McCarthy&lt;/a&gt; can become experts on vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On those sites, people can post and share whatever material they deem to be worthy and accurate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, sites such as Facebook can add to the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those social media sites track what information a person is interested in and feeds them more of the same. So, someone who thinks the coal industry doesn’t pollute the air will see more material along those same lines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Laura Boxley, PhD, director of clinical neuropsychology training, and assistant professor-clinical in the&amp;nbsp;Departments of&amp;nbsp;Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Neurology, and Psychology at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said this type of information can be more appealing to those reading it than accurate information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Real science is not sexy and fancy. It’s slow and steady,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This “confirmation bias” can produce and validate a person’s one-sided view.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of danger in accepting only one scientist’s opinion,” said Elliott.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond hardening an individual’s belief, scientific “fake news” can also affect government policy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Climate change is one high-profile example with a new president who, in the past, has proclaimed that the scientifically proven phenomenon is really just a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hoax&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The consequences are important,” said Brossard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Alternative facts in science,” added Elliott, “facilitate alternate facts in politics.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can be done?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts are urging several courses of action to stop or slow the spread of false scientific information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, they say scientists need to do a better job of communicating their research to the public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spouting off data and technical terms isn’t going to get it done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They add society should start teaching teenagers in middle school and high school how real science works. That way they’ll be able to spot phony research when they’re adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Teaching this early builds lifelong skills,” said Boxley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This highlights the importance of developing a sophisticated citizenry,” added Elliott.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experts also urge the country to better fund and better respect places where real scientific work is done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need to double down on our institutions,” said Boxley.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, they urge the public to avoid the temptation to share dubious information on social media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s really hard to break that echo chamber,” said Brossard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, she said, search engines such as Google should eliminate research that has been debunked from its system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She pointed out that Wakefield’s vaccine study can still be called up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Institutions, she added, can also monitor the internet and then perform “damage control” if they see incorrect information out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

TRPPT also shows significant success in helping decrease depressive symptoms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By thinking positively, people who perceive stress as less threatening are able to cope with it more effectively, while people who think negatively do not expect things to go as planned and tend to anticipate bad outcomes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, TRPPT is free, has no side effects or limits, and is even accessible in places like war-torn Syria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Helping people with MS&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strategies like TRPPT could benefit people with MS in particular because studies indicate there are high levels of depression among people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One study looked at the first year after an MS diagnosis and the associated &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13548506.2016.1274043&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;psychological impact&lt;/a&gt;. Many people with MS chose to avoid the illness, pretending they were not sick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the study showed a high prevalence of depression. It also showed a reduction in quality of life as a result of lower self-concept and psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to one &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1352458506070926&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, there are two questions you need to ask to determine if you need a hug. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the past two weeks, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;During the past two weeks, have you often been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;Answering “Yes” to one or both of these questions could signify some depression, a common and serious emotion that should be discussed with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When people struggle with physical discomfort, it’s not uncommon to experience feeling depressed or a lack of motivation. Especially with MS, when you don’t know exactly when the next flare-up will occur, it can be hard to keep your head up.” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.drjenniferjones.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jennifer Johnston-Jones&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a psychologist in Southern California, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Often people turn toward Band-Aid treatments such as medication or distractions such as overuse of television, social media, or not committing to the work they are meant to do. Instead, one can focus their efforts on strategies that increase their self-concept and self-worth which will naturally decrease depression.” Jones added. “Some of these strategies include: doing a daily gratitude journal, doing things a little out of your comfort zone, and sharing your vulnerability with others.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stress on relationships&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having MS can also affect your relationships — creating situations that may require people to seek professional help.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One program based in Colorado, &lt;a href=&quot;http://ijmsc.org/doi/abs/10.7224/1537-2073.2012-002?code=cmsc-site&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Relationship Matters (RM)&lt;/a&gt;, is a relationship enrichment program that integrates information and resources of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society with marriage education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National MS Society has a variety of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Resources-Support/Library-Education-Programs/You-CAN/Fan-the-Flame&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tips&lt;/a&gt; to help flame the romance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is to create rituals and traditions. Make it a habit to acknowledge and celebrate your relationship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another is to find ways to express caring and appreciation in your relationship every day. It could be as simple as a gentle stroke on the cheek.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Loving yourself can also help. Being positive can help traditional medicines &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5221550/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;work better&lt;/a&gt; due primarily to better adherence, while depression was associated with a lower likelihood of adherence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MS takes a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3883007/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;self-management&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study at the University of Washington, and part of this is the ability to love oneself and to love others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

’re getting older.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And with aging comes a certain amount of change, especially when it comes to your body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Activities that you could easily do in your 20s now require a bit of caution — if not a note of permission from your primary care physician.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Luckily, you can continue to be physically active well into your golden years, provided you’ve established a good foundation early on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And even if you haven’t, it’s never too late to get (back) into shape. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exercise is the ultimate anti-aging treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers are emphatic about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://uic.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/exercise-and-physical-activity-for-older-adults&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;correlation&lt;/a&gt; between exercising and fitness and the body and mind, contributing to a decreased prevalence of injury, illness, and other negative aspects of getting older.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s how to combat the effects of growing older and achieve peak performance condition no matter what your age. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exercising in your 30s&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/how-lungs-work/lung-capacity-and-aging.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stamina and bone densities&lt;/a&gt; at their peaks, now is the perfect time to lay the foundation for a long-term relationship with fitness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your league sports games and pickup matches may be less frequent, but that should allow you the time and energy for other activities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High intensity cross training or circuit training with cardio and resistance (i.e., weights) will help you develop overall fitness, which may be lacking if you have always participated in just one or two sports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It will also help prevent injuries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exercise in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/strength-training/how-endurance-strength-training-can-benefit-your-health.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;intense bursts&lt;/a&gt; at 80 to 95 percent of your max, interspersed with recovery pauses to allow your heart rate to return to normal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to be &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/how-long-to-get-in-shape&quot;&gt;more effective than prolonged&lt;/a&gt; cardio-only training. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women, in particular, should start prioritizing intense strength training as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/19/health/law-of-diminishing-returns-for-athletes.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;marathon treadmill sessions&lt;/a&gt; won’t be as effective as they once were.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aim to exercise five times a week with one day reserved for high intensity cardio (at least 45 minutes). Switch your routine up often to avoid diminishing returns, and plan for a once-a-week rest day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your exercise regimen should also include balance and flexibility training. This will become more important as you age. Low-impact activities like yoga, tai chi, and dancing integrate stretching and breath work into movement. (Bonus: yoga, for one, has been proven to &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2007.6338&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stave off depression&lt;/a&gt; by increasing your brain’s GABA levels.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just don’t let up&lt;/strong&gt;: Your metabolism has already begun &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/basal-metabolic-rate-changes-as-you-age/2013/03/05/d26b1c18-80f1-11e2-a350-49866afab584_story.html?utm_term=.12591abea599&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;slowing down&lt;/a&gt;, requiring doing more exercise and taking in fewer calories to avoid putting on fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t leave proper form at the gym&lt;/strong&gt;: Walk upright, focusing on keeping your abs activated to avoid hunching later in life. And &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; take the stairs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featured exercise: Burpees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These full-body exercises will quickly and efficiently wear you out (in a good way). They require no special equipment — all you need is a timer — and can be done just about anywhere. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Get into a squat and position your hands on the floor in front of you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kick your feet straight back while lowering yourself into the “down” part of a pushup, arms bent at 90 degrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jump your feet back to their original position while pushing your torso up with your arms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From the squat, jump straight up, as high as possible, reaching your arms toward the ceiling or sky.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Come back down into a squat and repeat the series of movements, moving from one position to the next as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Start by doing 20 seconds of burpees, resting for 10 seconds, and repeating eight times, for a total of four minutes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Extend the amount of time you spend moving between rest periods or increase the total amount of time you spend doing the exercises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exercising in your 40s&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the official start of middle age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A combination of more time sitting at a desk job, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.today.com/health/confronting-between-decade-2D&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hormonal changes&lt;/a&gt;, and a naturally occurring muscle mass loss — with men dropping &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3940510/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;5 to 8 percent&lt;/a&gt; of their muscle mass every decade after they turn 40 — makes for a slower metabolism and the seemingly inevitable middle-aged paunch, increasing the chances for a bad lower back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On top of that, your fat distribution will change internally, putting additional weight on and around your organs and increasing the risks of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You still have great potential to reverse decades of aging and improve your body shape while upping your energy levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jap.physiology.org/content/98/4/1154.short&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt; will ward off cardiovascular disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keep up a consistent exercise regimen to preserve lean muscle mass and keep fat gains minimal. Even 10 minutes of activity is better than none.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Continue training with weights three to four times a week, and up the cardio to five times a week, reserving one day for rest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In terms of strength training, remember quality over quantity. Focus on doing the movements slowly and with control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now is the time to make stretching a priority. Invest a few bucks in a foam roller. It will help with your flexibility by loosening and relaxing muscles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maintaining or improving flexibility will be crucial in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featured exercise: Squat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A staple of most gym workouts, the squat directly affects the large muscles of your legs — quads, hamstrings, and calves — and also promotes overall muscle gain which in turn helps burn fat. Squats also help improve your balance and mobility. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lower yourself down by bending your knees, pushing your hips back, until your thighs are at least perpendicular with the floor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keep your back flat and avoid allowing your knees to move forward beyond the length of your feet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pause at the bottom, then activate your leg muscles to raise yourself back up. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Initially, your bodyweight will be sufficient as you learn to perform the movements with proper form and control. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With time you can add intensity by positioning a barbell across your shoulders or holding dumbbells in both hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exercising in your 50s&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;You are likely experiencing more drooping as you lose muscle tone and your shoulders start to &lt;a href=&quot;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hunch forward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Focus on saving your back by strengthening your core muscles and keeping good posture. Yoga and Pilates are helpful for both.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may also discover that the soreness and fatigue the day after a workout is becoming more than occasional.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some activities may exacerbate pain, so alter your exercise routine accordingly rather than letting it discourage you from exercising at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your knees are bothering you from running, try riding a bike or swimming instead. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will also need additional recovery time after a hard workout, so go easy — aim to exercise more frequently but with a moderate level of intensity. Ideally, get in a half-hour of cardio every day. Studies show that regular exercise will &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/607859&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increase your aerobic capacity&lt;/a&gt;, keeping your muscles and lungs healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Train with weights twice a week and develop an affinity for the kettlebell as it is good for complex exercises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be fanatical about stretching hard after every workout. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featured exercise: Sun Salutations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Sun Salutation — Surya Namaskar, in Sanskrit — is a specific series of yoga poses that flow from one to the next. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Typically used as a warmup in yoga classes, Sun Salutations stretch and strengthen all the major muscle groups. Linking movements to breathing also helps reduce stress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stand with your feet hip-width apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Press your palms together in front of your chest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sweep your arms out and overhead while inhaling.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exhale as you fold forward at your hips, reaching your hands toward the floor and bending your knees as necessary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inhale as you lift your torso up halfway, bringing your back to parallel with the floor, open palms pointed toward your shins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exhale as you step your feet back one at a time or jump both feet back together to come to a plank pose, continuing to exhale as you lower your body to the floor by bending your elbows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inhale as you straighten your arms, extending your chest forward, and drawing your shoulders back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exhale as you lift your hips, pushing down with your hands and feet to lengthen your spine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take five breaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On your last exhalation, bend your knees and look forward between your hands. Inhale as you step or jump your feet in between your hands and again lift your back halfway, bringing your back parallel with the floor and pointing your fingers toward your shins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exhale as you fold forward at your hips, again reaching your hands towards the floor and bending your knees as necessary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Inhale as you sweep your arms out and overhead. Exhale as you bring your palms together in front of your chest. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Repeat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exercising in your 60s&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although you may still be planning to become a world-class bodybuilder or swimsuit model at 65, your goal should now be prevention — preventing disease, such as diabetes and heart disease, falling, and frailty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regular exercise is still the way to go, with emphasis on maintaining balance and strength.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weight training is a must, ideally three times a week, alternating between upper and lower body muscle groups and using light weights. Your bones are a bit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45503/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;more fragile&lt;/a&gt; and the tendons and ligaments holding you together aren’t as supple as they once were, so be careful. Better yet, work with a professional trainer to avoid injury. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Low-impact group exercise classes like Zumba and water aerobics will get your blood flowing without adding strain. And working out with others should make for comradery and accountability around working out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Group walks, for instance, have been shown to have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/media-room/press-release-archive/-/asset_publisher/a2jEGMiFHPhv/content/uea-research-shows-group-walking-cuts-risk-of-life-threatening-conditions&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;additional health benefits&lt;/a&gt; when compared with solo walking. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aim for three days a week of moderately intense cardio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you run, take heart: an hour-and-a-half of slow to moderately paced jogging over the course of the week could &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-05/esoc-rjs050212.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;increase your life expectancy&lt;/a&gt; by as much as five years, according to research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Incorporate balance exercises and stretch, stretch, stretch. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featured exercise: Single-leg deadlift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Isolateral exercises like the single-leg deadlift work one side of the body at a time, as opposed to training both sides at once.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This allows training to continue around an injury and also corrects strength asymmetries. Most importantly, they improve general balance and equilibrium. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stand on one leg, firmly planting your toes and heel into the floor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Slightly bend your standing leg as you extend your free leg behind you, leaning forward with your torso and reaching your arms towards the floor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Continue to lower yourself until your torso is parallel to the floor. Lift yourself back up slowly and with control. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increase intensity by adding a weight — a kettlebell is ideal. Hold the weight in the hand on the same side as your standing leg, lowering it in front of you as you bend down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Return the weight to your side as you return to the upright position.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Exercising past age 70&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exercise is beneficial at every age. Continuing to work on your strength, flexibility, and balance will keep you spry and independent long past 70.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It will also help you &lt;a href=&quot;http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/blog/2007/03/12/new-reason-to-hit-the-gym-fighting-memory-loss-3/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;retain your memories&lt;/a&gt;, according to a recent study. And though your morning constitutional walk is a perfectly fine starting point, don’t stop there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Incorporate stretching and working light weights and resistance bands into your regimen. Staying strong will increase your chances of surviving a fall; women in their 60s and 70s have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3048257/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;five-fold chance&lt;/a&gt; of dying within a year of suffering a hip fracture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When working out, be sure to check in with yourself when you experience pain as it may necessitate changing up your exercises. If the pain continues, visit your doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featured exercise: Heal-to-toe walk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Improving your balance and stability will decrease your chances of falling and make going up and down steps easier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you feel unsteady on your feet, do this exercise alongside a wall so you can steady yourself as necessary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Position the heel of one foot directly in front of the toes of the other foot so your feet are nearly touching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Focus on a spot ahead of you and take a step, placing your moving foot’s heel directly in front of the toes of your stationary foot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeat.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They can cause effects such as elevated heart rate and blood pressure, and increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and aneurysm rupture.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the new study was observational, it didn’t establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship between amphetamine use and cardiovascular aging. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also didn’t provide information on the dose of amphetamines that may prematurely age the heart. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ninety-four percent of the study participants who used amphetamines had done so in the week prior to testing. The effects of amphetamine exposure persisted after adjustment for all known cardiovascular risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Reece, the study is one part of a larger picture: The quest to understand — and reverse — aging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve measured arterial stiffness,” he said. “We need to look at molecular levels of aging.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reversing aging is one of the Holy Grails of modern medicine, and each new discovery is important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Granger, who is also a spokesman for the American Heart Association, paints a picture of stimulant drug use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Amphetamine use can be harmful to the heart, particularly for patients who have underlying risk factors,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Generally drugs that stimulate the nervous system, including the adrenal glands, can be harmful. They directly administer a toxin to the heart, they overstimulate it, and wear it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s more,” he added, “they contribute to risk factors like high blood pressure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As a person gets older, overstimulation is bad for the heart,” Granger explained. “Some drugs, like cocaine, can cause a heart attack or increase other risk factors and contribute to cardiac arrhythmia.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Risks of other stimulant drugs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other drugs such as Adderall also present a potential danger. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adderall contains a combination of amphetamine and dextroamphetamine, which are central nervous system stimulants that affect chemicals in the brain and nerves that contribute to hyperactivity and impulse control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It can cause side effects other than withdrawal or crashing. Taking Adderall in high doses is called chronic intoxication and can cause feelings of euphoria and excitement. This can lead to addiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other side effects of taking the drug at a high dosage include a skin condition, insomnia, hyperactivity, irritability, and changes in personality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Granger notes that clinicians don’t have measurable proof that Adderall is harmful. “It’s relatively safe,” he said, “but there’s still some risk.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those risks increase when the drug is overused, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other drugs, like asthma drugs used as inhalers, are stimulants as well, Granger said. “There have been reports that asthma drugs may increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Drugs that stimulate the adrenals are a big public health issue,” he said, urging caution and awareness of risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the picture is not entirely bleak. There are some ways “we can reverse aging,” Reece said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most significant and meaningful way of undoing arterial damage is with plenty of exercise — better than any pill, according to Reece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that drugs make people old [and] fat,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sort of like Dorian Gray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Another problem is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arthritis.org/advocate/our-policy-priorities/access-to-care/increase-access-to-pediatric-rheumatologists/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;national shortage&lt;/a&gt; of pediatric rheumatology specialists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also the issue that the umbrella term “juvenile arthritis” actually encompasses several unique childhood rheumatologic diseases. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Furthering the confusion surrounding JA is whether or not it is actually a separate and distinct disease from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or if it is simply early-onset or pediatric RA, meaning, the same disease diagnosed at a younger age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Researchers may have found link&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2016/12/20/annrheumdis-2016-210025&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; may provide some clarity and guidance about the JA vs. RA conundrum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In it, researchers say a genetic link has been found between JA and RA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was already known among pediatric rheumatologists that some kinds of juvenile idiopathic arthritis have adult counterparts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Past research also showed that there was a genetic link between juvenile idiopathic arthritis and a chromosomal abnormality, but the sample sizes were weak. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the new study, genetic associations within juvenile idiopathic arthritis categories were compared with adult inflammatory arthritis. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a press release about the study, “A major finding was that there were within-category associations for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Specifically, the study team found that rheumatoid factor (RF)-negative polyarticular and oligoarticular were genetically similar. Comparisons with adult disease showed a shared association of human leucocyte antigen-DRB1 amino acid at position 13 for both child-onset and adult diseases. Moreover, researchers found that associations from a combined dataset for juvenile idiopathic arthritis types oligoarthritis and RF-negative polyarthritis were the same associations seen in adult seronegative rheumatoid arthritis.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors of the study added, “The results of this study have important implications for understanding disease pathogenesis, aetiology, and potential future therapeutic strategies for JIA categories,” but they note that more genetic research will need to be done into JA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Could research lead to treatments?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it is possible that these findings may eventually provide better, more targeted novel treatment therapies for JA and RA patients alike.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or at least may open up treatment options to JA patients who have been limited by the “juvenile” component of their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report states that, “There are no specific therapeutic strategies for seronegative RA at this time, but given the rarity of this subphenotype of RA and the JIA categories individually, this study suggests that further comparisons of genetic studies for these diseases could help identify novel pathways and targets for therapy for both adult-onset and childhood-onset forms of inflammatory arthritis.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hss.edu/conditions_arthritis-children-adolescents.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; in The Hospital for Special Surgery, “For more than 95 percent of the children with arthritis, we don't need new drugs or miraculous inventions, we just need proper application of the resources we already have.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a missed JA diagnosis or delayed treatment can be catastrophic, as evidenced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2801846/five-year-old-boy-died-crippling-arthritis/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent reports&lt;/a&gt; out of the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same can be said for adult-onset RA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether they share these genetic commonalities or not, both diseases are among the most disabling in their respective age demographic — and both can affect more than bones and joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
t;p&gt;I was 24 years old when I donated my eggs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first time was in June 2007. The second was January 2008.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d seen fliers across my college campus for years soliciting egg donors, but it wasn’t until a friend of mine went through the process herself that I became interested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I liked the idea of helping an infertile couple build the family they yearned for. I was about to graduate college, so the money attached to egg donation seemed like a good way to start tackling my student loan debt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps most importantly, I believed agency officials when they told me that egg donation was a simple and safe process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was deemed a “perfect” donor. All my tests came back great. I was young, healthy, fit, and college educated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which apparently also made me easily marketable in their database.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prior to donating, I was informed of the potential risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A nurse gave me a sheet of paper that listed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-hyperstimulation-syndrome-ohss/home/ovc-20263580&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)&lt;/a&gt; and infection from surgery as the most likely risks, although she told me those were pretty rare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Possible infertility was also listed as a much less common risk, but she patted me on the back and said, “There are no studies showing that’s a real risk. We just have to put it there, just in case. You’re young and healthy. You have nothing to worry about.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so, I signed on the dotted line. And I began injecting myself with high dose hormones to produce eggs for two families who were desperate to conceive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A painful reaction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both of my donations went smoothly, with 14 eggs retrieved each time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I felt fully recovered within days of retrieval. It wasn’t until six months after my second donation that I began to experience complications. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first sign that something was wrong came when my period just stopped. Months went by with no sign of my cycle. Then when it did return, it was with excruciating pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I began running fevers every time I got my period, doubling over in such pain that I couldn’t walk and often vomited because I was hurting so badly. That pain began to extend into my day-to-day life, even when I wasn’t on my period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An ultrasound showed my ovaries were covered in tumorlike growths. I had surgery shortly after that, and those growths were found to be endometriomas, or blood-filled cysts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed with stage 4 endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’d never experienced any problems with my period prior to donating. There had never been any reason to believe I had endometriosis before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But endometriosis is an estrogen-driven condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After looking at my before and after records, several doctors have told me they believe I likely had an underlying case of endometriosis that flared and became extremely aggressive as a result of the hormones involved in donating.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Egg donation did not give me endometriosis. But it did cause my condition to become unmanageable, which ultimately led to my swift diagnosis of infertility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Facing the fertility facts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 27 years old, I pursued two rounds of in vitro fertilization (IVF) myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My egg quality had diminished greatly in just the few years since I had donated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both rounds failed, and I had to come to terms with the fact that while my egg donations had produced two children, I would never be pregnant myself. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the three years following the donation of my eggs, I required five major surgeries and several expensive drug therapies to treat endometriosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just about infertility. It was about quality of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In total, I spent about $60,000 out of pocket in medical expenses. None of this was covered by my donations, from which I had earned about $12,000.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, the agency I donated through simply stopped returning my calls and emails upon learning how aggressive my condition had become. They didn’t even help me to obtain my donation medical records. I eventually had to pay the clinics I donated at for access to those records. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every specialist who has seen my before and after records has agreed there is no denying my donations likely played some role in my condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The progression was just too fast, too aggressive, to not be linked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But plenty in the industry continue to claim that egg donation is completely safe, even though there is no actual research to back up that claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No research on risks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nurse who told me there was no research showing egg donation might cause infertility wasn’t lying.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She was simply playing on the fact that there was no research at all. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There has never been a long-term study into the health risks of egg donation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plenty of doctors will point to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK327768/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; that exists about the safety of IVF and other fertility treatments. They say the same drugs are used for egg donation, and so the same safety conclusions can be drawn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But StatNews recently published an article on this subject, confronting that very conclusion by pointing out that the women followed in that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/28/egg-donors-risks/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; have been primarily women with infertility. These women are often over the age of 35 and already struggling with infertility, which can be a symptom of other health problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, egg donors are typically under the age of 25 with no such health concerns. Yet they are being given the same drugs and dosages as women with very different health profiles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s fair to say they’re not the same population,” Dr. Richard J. Paulson, president of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, told StatNews. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While egg donation has existed for 30 years, we simply don’t have any definitive research about the safety to donors or the long-term risks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Assessing the risks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diane Tober, PhD, an anthropologist, and assistant adjunct professor at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Nursing, has been trying to change all this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has obtained a pilot grant and is spearheading a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weareeggdonors.com/blog/2016/1/8/diane-tober&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comprehensive study&lt;/a&gt; on international egg donation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What she’s found so far does raise some red flags. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One thing doctors and agencies should really be doing is looking first at preventable risks,” Tober told Healthline. “We know that one risk that can be controlled is OHSS. There is a very clear cause and effect, and it is absolutely preventable. But one of the things I’m seeing is that, especially in the U.S., many donors are producing really high quantities of eggs. In many of my interviews internationally, they are producing between 10 and 12 eggs each cycle. Eighteen is considered high risk for OHSS. But here in the U.S., so many of the donors I’ve spoken to have produced 30, 40, 50 eggs. They are being told by doctors and agencies that they are superdonors, ‘fertile Myrtles.’ But the reality is, these superproducing cycles put them at much higher risk for OHSS, which could be prevented if doctors were monitoring their progress throughout the cycle and adjusting their meds so that they didn’t overproduce.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Many of the conditions that donors do experience,” she added, “can be linked to excess estrogen [endometriosis and certain types of cancer, for instance]. I believe that when screening donors, we absolutely need to screen out carriers of the BRCA gene. Women who do carry the BRCA gene aren’t even supposed to use hormone-based contraceptives.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet we’re allowing donors to pump themselves full of hormones without first confirming whether or not they may be at greater risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://draimee.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh&lt;/a&gt;, a Harvard-educated, board certified OB-GYN specializing in reproductive endocrinology and infertility, agrees with the need to better screen donors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Every donor should have an inherited cancer test,” Eyvazzadeh told Healthline. “They should have a fertility gene test. If you have endometriosis, you should not donate.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Eyvazzadeh believes that egg donation is generally safe for most women, she concedes, “There are women for whom it is dangerous to donate, without a doubt.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can be done&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why aren’t more agencies and clinics pushing for this testing? Why aren’t they taking steps to better screen and protect potential donors?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Eyvazzadeh, it’s about money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Donors think the agencies actually care about them. But those agencies are making more than double what the donors are making, without taking any of the risk on themselves, she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eyvazzadeh is trying to change that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She wants to see research done into the long-term emotional implications of egg donation for donors. And she wants to see financial compensation removed from the egg donation process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, she’d like to see donors compensated with shared cycles, where some of their eggs could be frozen and stored for their own future use, should they ever face infertility themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She wants to put the power back into donors’ hands, effectively cutting out agencies and allowing donors to be their own brokers — where they own their eggs, and can freeze and share on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also choosing who they donate to and operating with total transparency, where donors are given just as much information about their recipient families as recipient families are given about donors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s been nearly 10 years since I first donated, and in that time I’ve heard a lot of horror stories of donors being taken advantage of and mistreated by the agencies they have donated through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Removing the financial compensation and cutting out agencies reduces those risks. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But I also still firmly believe that the one thing donors need, and deserve the most, is long-term research into the potential health effects of donating, so that they can give truly informed consent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tober agrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“From an anecdotal perspective, in my study so far out of 100 women, there are about five that did experience infertility not long after egg donation,” she said. “Some of those cases were endometriosis or cancer, and for one woman, her hormones never returned to normal after donating. We don’t know for sure if there is a causal connection. I can’t say it’s definitely linked. But there is enough reason for concern to warrant a push for more information.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only question is how many cases like mine will it take before more doctors and agencies will join the push for that research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or is it possible that with so much money on the line, that push will never come?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

;&lt;p&gt;A new app approved in Europe claims to defy the old joke “What do you call a couple who uses the rhythm method?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Answer: Parents)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Natural Cycles is the world’s first regulatory approved app for contraception, offering couples an option besides condoms, the pill, and IUDs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It received &lt;a href=&quot;http://venturebeat.com/2017/02/09/natural-cycles-is-first-contraceptive-app-to-get-eu-approval/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;class IIb medical device status&lt;/a&gt; from a German inspection firm employed by the United Kingdom’s regulatory agency for healthcare products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, women across the world can access the app. More than 150,000 users in 161 countries currently use it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I love that the hormones are gone and that I get to know my own body in a different way. I am more aware of my cycle and my own natural hormones,” Sara Flyckt, a London resident, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flyckt used the app for two years to prevent pregnancy after using both contraception injections and several types of contraceptive pills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I never really felt that they agreed with me and the hormones made me very unstable,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Avoiding hormone therapy for contraception is exactly why Elina Berglund Scherwitzl and Raoul Scherwitzl, husband and wife creators of Natural Cycles, developed the app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t want to use hormones anymore, and I wasn’t exactly excited to use a condom every time, having been in a relationship,” Elina Scherwitzl, PhD, told Healthline. “We looked into natural family planning solutions, but there was nothing out there that made it easy and reliable to use.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Scherwitzls, who both have doctorates in physics, applied their math skills to the natural family planning method, developed an algorithm, and created the app they believe is safe and easy to use. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We packaged it into a mobile app to make it user-friendly and scalable at the same time,” Scherwitzl says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Users who sign up for the app for a year receive a free basal thermometer to track their temperature.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The yearly subscription costs $4.99 per month. Access to the app is also available for $8.99 per month, but this plan doesn’t include a thermometer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyone can have a free trial for one month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each morning, you take your temperature and enter it into the app. An algorithm then determines your fertility that day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hl-poll&quot; style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9671710.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://polldaddy.com/poll/9671710/&quot;&gt;Would you be comfortable using a temperature app for birth control?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the app determines it’s a green day, then you can have unprotected intercourse. If it informs you that it’s a red day, then you should use protection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard and read a few comments that people seem to think that it’s tricky to have to take your temperature every morning, but it really couldn’t be easier,” Flyckt says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She puts her thermometer on top of her phone since it’s the first thing she usually reaches for when she wakes up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That helps you to remember,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scherwitzl says the app’s method differs from traditional fertility awareness methods because the rhythm method leaves assumptions about when a woman ovulates, or requires her to analyze her body temperature on her own. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is very error prone as you don’t only have the human error at play, but also you have to use very simplified statistical methods as well as only analyze one cycle at the time,” Scherwitzl says. “Our algorithm takes all this away by doing more advanced calculations and simply returning red or green, thus removing the human error, and it is always extra cautious in the first months before it has enough data from this person to be able to safely give green days, without making any assumptions about the unique user’s cycle or ovulation date.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;As effective as the pill?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/behindtheheadlines/news/2016-04-15-would-you-trust-a-smartphone-app-as-a-contraceptive/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2016 clinical study&lt;/a&gt; of women using Natural Cycles to prevent pregnancy, performed by the Scherwitzls along with the Karolinska Institute, showed the app was as effective as birth control pills. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results reported a perfect use Pearl Index of 0.5 (99.5 percent effective) and a typical use Pearl Index of 7.0 (93 percent effective). This means five women per 1,000 would become pregnant per year due to the Natural Cycles app giving the wrong green day. Seven out of 100 women would become pregnant due to any reason. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Other contraceptives, such as the hormonal contraceptive pill, are in similar ranges, while contraceptive methods that are inside your body such as the hormonal implant or the IUD have higher typical use Pearl Index rates as the human error is minimal,” Scherwitzl says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, Dr. Jane Oh, an OB-GYN in Illinois, says a Pearl Index of 7 sounds unrealistic. She states that most OB-GYN textbooks suggest that the natural rhythm method has a Pearl Index of about 20. This means 20 per 100 women will get pregnant in a year when using that method.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In real life, I would expect it to be much less effective in terms of preventing pregnancy. Especially if you have highly irregular cycles,” Oh told Healthline. “In the best case scenario, natural family planning with or without the app should work pretty well, but specific criteria must be met.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh says the criteria includes a woman who has regular periods, and two disciplined adults with excellent self-control who are not devastated if they do become pregnant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In other words, a highly organized and motivated couple,” says Oh. “This is not the real world. That’s why the best forms of birth control to date are ones that do not depend on the person doing anything for years and years, like IUDs, sterilization, and Nexplanon implants.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scherwitzl agrees that the app is for couples in stable relationships who are willing to use protection on red days. Since the study was performed on women above the age of 18, she does not recommend anyone younger using the app. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because Natural Cycles does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), Scherwitzl stresses that it “Should therefore only be used by stable couples when the woman knows and trusts her partner.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can it help you &lt;em&gt;get&lt;/em&gt; pregnant?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh says the natural rhythm method is effective in helping women become pregnant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Flyckt wanted to become pregnant, she used Natural Cycles to help plan her pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I did this for about one year and I am now pregnant in week 30,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scherwitzl is currently conducting a third clinical study on the app’s effectiveness in helping women become pregnant by investigating what variables impact time for pregnancy and infertility. These include age, BMI, previous contraception, intercourse rate, and cycle regularity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the results have not been published yet, Scherwitzl says she can share some insight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What is clear is that we help users plan the most when they are less likely to have intercourse on the most fertile day by chance. This is especially users that have irregular cycles, early or late ovulation, or intercourse less frequently,” Scherwitzl says. “Previous contraception is also very important. If they used Natural Cycles to prevent pregnancy before, they usually get pregnant very fast once they switch to plan, as both the app and the woman have a good understanding of her cycle already.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Will Men Ever Embrace Male Birth Control?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mens-health/022217_malebirthcontrol_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s said you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same might be true when it comes to men and birth control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new form of male birth control — an injectable gel that blocks sperm flow — has cleared its latest round of clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vasalgel, an experimental contraceptive developed by researchers at the Parsemus Foundation, was found to be a safe and successful form of birth control in male monkeys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers published their findings in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bacandrology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12610-017-0048-9&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Basic and Clinical Andrology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that the gel injection will be more easily reversible than a vasectomy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts and advocacy groups welcome new methods of family planning, but they say there are more hurdles to clear — both scientific and cultural — before Vasalgel or other forms of male contraceptives are widely embraced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A survey of Healthline readers indicates the resistance of men to birth control may be quite real.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A crucial function&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just about any couple can attest to the importance of birth control.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And while modern couples have several options — whether condoms, vasectomy, or the female birth control pill — it’s always good to have other alternatives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, chief medical officer at Planned Parenthood Federation of America, outlined in an email to Healthline some of the reasons it’s important to have options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s important to note that birth control methods are not one-size-fits-all, so a method that’s perfect for one person may not be right for another,” she wrote. “In addition to health and the likelihood of side effects, some of the most common factors that people consider when weighing birth control methods are effectiveness at preventing pregnancy, ease of use, future childbearing plans, cost, privacy, and partner acceptance. Age and the permanence of the method are also factors to consider.“&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Terry O’Neill, president of the National Association for Women (NOW), says the development of male contraceptives is great news.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the more that people are able to control their own bodies, the better off we are,” she told Healthline. “Male birth control doesn’t mean that women won’t be utilizing birth control. Clearly, women will continue to use birth control because every woman has the right to decide for herself when she will have children, if ever. But what’s good, I think, about the development of male birth control is that men should have control over their own bodies.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McDonald-Mosley says the research and development of male contraceptives should “absolutely” be a public health priority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It would provide couples with more options for preventing unintended pregnancies,” she said. “Providing men with better and greater contraceptive options would also enable men to play a more active role in the mutual planning and pregnancy and the prevention of unintended pregnancies — a role that Planned Parenthood greatly encourages and supports.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Changing norms&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest question marks surrounding the development of male contraceptives is whether or not men will actually embrace the new methods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In order to understand the likelihood of whether or not men will use contraceptives, you have to understand that probably the most unfair aspect of human evolution is that women evolved in a way that makes sex a much higher cost,” Dr. Wendy Walsh, a relationship expert, told Healthline. “Because of their unique biology, women are much more susceptible to contracting an STI, much more susceptible to bonding and falling in love with a jerk because women’s bodies emit oxytocin, the bonding hormone, during orgasm. And, of course, women are much more likely to contract an 18-year case of parenthood because our culture is not one where men are doing the bulk of the child care.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-health/11693404/Male-Pill-More-than-half-of-men-cant-wait-to-take-it.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Telegraph poll&lt;/a&gt; showed that slightly more than half of men surveyed would definitely take a male birth control pill if it became widely available, while about a quarter said they weren’t sure, and another quarter said they wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an online survey that 570 Healthline readers answered, 34 percent of men said they’d be willing to get an injection that blocks the flow of sperm for several months while 66 percent said they wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When asked if they’d be willing to receive a series of shots that blocked sperm production, 27 percent said “Yes” while 73 percent said “No.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite these survey results, some experts see change down the road.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Urologist Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt, co-director of the Personalized Urology &amp;amp; Robotics Clinic at South Lake Hospital in Clermont, Fla., in partnership with Orlando Health, says he’s hopeful that men will embrace new methods as they become available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I deal with men on a daily basis and there definitely is an interest,” he told Healthline. “But right now, I have very little to offer. I can tell them to use a condom or have a vasectomy. But condoms have a 10 percent failure rate. Withdrawal, where they pull out, has a 20 percent failure rate. And with vasectomies, they get worried that they’ll want to have kids in the future. But if there is something out there, I think a lot of guys will do it — especially younger men. With the millennial generation becoming very tech savvy and proactive when it comes to overall health, I think guys, even knowing their female partner is on birth control, will get this as well, just to be doubly sure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walsh also says she sees a generational shift happening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think men are evolving, especially with the millennial generation,” she told Healthline. “I feel optimistic about the future, especially with the younger generation and the amount of child care that this generation of men is doing or thinking of doing. I feel optimistic that it’s changing, I really do.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Vasalgel shows promise, it’s just one of several proposed methods of male contraception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A different &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37790450&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;injection method&lt;/a&gt; — this one involving hormones — was explored but halted because of unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Minnesota are looking into the possibility of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://license.umn.edu/technologies/z09075_reversible-non-hormonal-male-contraceptive&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;non-hormonal birth control pill&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s also the future possibility of a literal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livescience.com/54105-which-male-birth-control-works.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on/off switch&lt;/a&gt; implanted under the skin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brahmbhatt says he thinks the pill is still years away from becoming viable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would say it’s decades away from becoming a reality,” he said. “Right now it’s just a concept, and they haven’t really done any studies on the actual switch part, or how they’re going to be putting it inside humans.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthline readers seem a bit reluctant about this option at the moment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the online survey, 31 percent of respondents said they would be willing to take a daily pill to stop sperm production while 69 percent said they wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When asked if a risk of side effects, such as acne or depression were involved, 61 percent said they’d be less likely to try this birth control option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tough times ahead&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The future of male contraceptives is fraught with both medical and cultural challenges, the future of family planning in general seems poised to face significant political problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We know the transformative effect birth control has on people’s lives. We see it every day in our patients and supporters,” wrote McDonald-Mosley of Planned Parenthood’s mission. “There’s a lot to celebrate around birth control: the ability to plan, prevent, and space pregnancies is directly linked to benefits to women, men, children, and society, including more educational and economic opportunities, healthier babies, and more stable families. It can also enhance people’s sex lives, helping them feel less stressed about getting pregnant.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the benefits that contraceptives provide, there’s a battle looming between groups like Planned Parenthood and the newly inaugurated administration of President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“On reproductive rights, we know that the administration is going to try to systematically block people from access to basic reproductive healthcare,” O’Neill said. “The defunding of Planned Parenthood is actually a bit of a smokescreen for defunding Title X family planning clinics generally. They’re not just going after Planned Parenthood — if they did, that would be unconstitutional. The only way to do it constitutionally is to cut off all funding for federal family planning clinic programs. Of course, that will be devastating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Tony Urey went into medicine for the same reason many of his medical school friends did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He wanted to give low-income Hispanic and Latino communities better healthcare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of his fellow students became family doctors, but Urey decided to specialize in the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most Hispanic and Latino doctors are internists or general practitioners, according to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of 2013, there were 1,044 U.S.-trained Hispanic and Latino cardiologists practicing in the United States — less than the number who went into surgery, psychiatry, or emergency medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a cardiology fellow, Urey is specializing in advanced heart failure and transplantation at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In medical school, Urey said he and his classmates had little exposure to cardiology in their training.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think that the exposure or the opportunities to serve the community in other areas [besides primary care] are not really well-explored by a lot of undergrads and medical students,” said Urey, a Los Angeles native who wanted to become a doctor because his mother struggled to get good care in the county health system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Looking for cardiologists&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say they wish more medical students in general chose to specialize in cardiology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But getting more racially and ethnically diverse cardiologists to treat patients in their respective communities is especially important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research shows minority patients, when given a choice, often seek out doctors from their same race or heritage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Urey decided to go into cardiology during his residency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, medical school programs and practicing cardiologists should start engaging children in elementary school, said Chicago cardiologist Dr. Kim A. Williams, Sr., chief of cardiology at Rush Medical College, and a past president of the American College of Cardiology (ACC).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first task is to get them interested in science, he said, and as they get older, to talk about medical school and cardiology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It really has to do with the [education] pipeline,” said Williams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The African-American physician often talks to high school students about going into medicine, but said he and his peers should do more to work with school districts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Williams is the head of cardiology at Rush University Medical Center, and co-chair of ACC’s new initiative to encourage more women and ethnic and racial minority physicians to pursue a career in cardiology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Available U.S. demographic data from the ACC show about 7 percent of its physician members identify as Hispanic or Latino.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Targeted efforts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medical schools are also targeting their efforts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Duke University School of Medicine has come a long way in changing the makeup of its student body since pediatric cardiologist Dr. Brenda Armstrong was a resident there in the mid-1970s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Armstrong was among faculty members in the 1990s who pushed to increase the number of minority medical students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We have built — and it's taken time — an understanding that this is a place where diversity is valued,” said Armstrong, the medical school's associate dean of medical education, and director of admissions for more than 20 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ohio State University’s medical school made it a priority more than a decade ago to recruit minority candidates for its cardiology fellowship program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before 2007, the program hadn’t had an African-American or Hispanic trainee since it started in 1967.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alex J. Auseon, DO, was the Ohio State program’s director from 2010 to 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We knew we couldn’t just do it at the end of the line,” he said. “We had to [get them interested in cardiology] early.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lack of graduates&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Auseon, who now oversees the cardiology fellowship program at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said another challenge is that there simply aren’t a lot of minority medical school graduates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And among that graduate pool, he wonders whether some may not apply because cardiology training is among the most challenging and demanding in medicine, or they don’t want to deal with the life-or-death situations linked to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having more Hispanic and Latino cardiology students isn’t just good for their future patients, it’s also good for medical programs, said Urey, who is of Guatemalan and Bolivian heritage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Training with people from different ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds better prepares doctors to care for a more diverse group of patients and better understand the health issues and cardiovascular disease risk factors that are unique to a particular ethnic group, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s especially important considering the growth of the U.S. Hispanic and Latino population, which rose from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-04.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;50 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2010 to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2016/cb16-ff16.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;56 million&lt;/a&gt; in 2015, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the second-leading cause of death among Hispanics and Latinos, who are more likely than whites to be obese, have diabetes, and be physically inactive — all risk factors for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some of these [Hispanic and Latino] communities have been largely underserved for decades,” said Urey. “Having someone that understands the culture, speaks the language, and has gone through some of the challenges the patients face is, I think, something that will benefit patient care — but also training of non-Latino physicians.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Editor’s Note: The &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/wanted-more-hispanic-and-latino-heart-doctors/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;original story&lt;/a&gt; was published on American Heart Association News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released a new report saying that the current vaccine is 48 percent effective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does that mean it’s worth it to get a flu shot?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If so, why do we keep hearing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/02/17/flu-vaccine-is-only-moderately-protective-this-year-cdc-says.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;negative reports&lt;/a&gt; about the flu vaccine this season?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year, the most common virus is the influenza A (H3N2) strain. The vaccine was estimated to be 43 percent effective against that strain, and 73 percent effective against the influenza B strain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CDC officials say they define the vaccine as 48 percent effective because it’s used more often against the H3N2 strain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A “bad” season?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A report published in the New England Journal of Medicine Journal Watch cited CDC data from Feb. 4 that said flu activity is widespread in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jwatch.org/fw112543/2017/02/13/much-country-seeing-high-flu-activity?query=pfw&amp;amp;jwd=000020000592&amp;amp;jspc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;43 states&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is much higher than average, the report added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another CDC report, published by the Associated Press (AP), called the season &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/01f125e2b43c429695f9b68adfffde66/US-flu-vaccine-a-good-match;-season-moderate-so-far&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;moderate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elodie Ghedin, PhD, a biology professor at New York University, said the season hasn’t been particularly bad despite some of the hype in reports. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The vaccine is well-matched compared to two years ago when it wasn't. And people are getting vaccinated at relatively the same rate as previous years,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates aren’t too different this year compared with others, Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, an immunobiology professor at Yale University, told Healthline&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Experts say you still need a flu shot&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a good but not great vaccine,” Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Tennessee, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Schaffner said the 48 percent efficacy figure is pretty normal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flu shot effectiveness can range from 35 percent to 65 percent, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, people should still get vaccinated, Schaffner said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The current strain disproportionally affects older adults and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=newssearch&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0lMmwrZ_SAhXJ1IMKHfUDDTwQqQIIMSgAMAI&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnbc4i.com%2F2017%2F02%2F14%2Fofficials-fourth-ohio-child-dies-from-flu-related-illnesses%2F&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEp-X1ZYNskbzI7l4mLNRXcMQPwow&amp;amp;sig2=f1REnMGilv1apUSzRdvzWA&amp;amp;bvm=bv.147448319,d.amc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;. It is also more likely to cause severe illness. Recent reports of child deaths from the flu have been prominent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Every year we have children who are hospitalized with the flu. Most of those children are not vaccinated,” Schaffner noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added that kids usually respond well to the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another reason to “run, do not walk” and get the vaccine: Those who get the vaccine may still experience the flu, but it will be much less severe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is something Schaffner said is not represented in the statistics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, getting the vaccine helps cut down on the spread of the virus overall. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It has a dual effect,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While it’s not too late to get a shot, Schaffner said people should get vaccinated in September or October so it covers the whole season.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is very important that people get the flu shot,” Iwasaki added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She noted that a nasal swab is the only way to tell if you have the flu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms include fever, chills, sore throat, aches, and fatigue that last for one to two weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stomach bugs such as rotavirus or norovirus are technically not caused by flu strains though some people refer to them by that name.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you do not get the flu shot and catch the flu, then you are suffering needlessly,” Iwasaki said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/022117_waterpollution_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Americans take clean water for granted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We turn on the tap and safe water to drink, bathe in, and cook and clean with comes out of the faucet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169488&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a growing water affordability problem on the horizon that could soon make water scarcer and more costly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fallout has the potential to be devastating to public health in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The true cost of water&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Utility companies actually take a loss on the cost of water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, between individual households’ water bills and government subsidies, they have historically made enough money to keep operating their businesses while also tackling long-term, fixed-cost infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But these infrastructure projects are increasingly eating up an unduly large part of most water and sewer companies’ costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As much as 80 percent of the agencies’ budgets go to replacing outdated infrastructure that was built around World War II.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Mack, PhD, an assistant professor at Michigan State University, and co-author of the study, says that replacing aging infrastructure in the United States is projected to cost at least $1 trillion over the next 25 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that’s not the only factor driving up the cost of water.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Slow or even declining population growth, which reduces the customer base over which the high fixed costs of water services are distributed,” is also affecting costs, according to Mack’s research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The system works better the more people there are in the system because the more people there are in the system, the lower the per-unit cost of supplying water, which reduces people’s bills,” Mack stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, the inability to pay for water has a cascading effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those who can’t afford to keep water flowing through their pipes cause utility companies to charge more to those who can, creating a larger population that can’t afford water. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This, combined with an exodus of city dwellers in favor of the suburbs, and an urgent need to update infrastructure, “present a perilous future for water utilities and their customers,” according to Mack’s study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Increasingly unaffordable water&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mack’s study estimates that “over the next few decades, water prices are anticipated to increase to four times current levels.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mack and another Michigan State professor found that water is currently unaffordable for about 12 percent of U.S. households, and this number could rise to 35 percent within the next five years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mack says the study started with “a simple question: ‘Can households afford their water and sewer bills?’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She says the answer is mostly yes, but maybe not for long, and certainly not for everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study found that those living in poverty can’t always pay their water bills. And though that’s not expected to change anytime soon, “I think what’s more interesting,” Mack says, “is that people who make below median income” — that is, around $51,000 per year — “are also going to be facing some sort of affordability concerns.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That means the problem is likely to affect millions of Americans — many of whom aren’t expecting it and can’t afford it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The case of Flint&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To combat the rising cost of providing water to its residents, officials in Flint, Mich. — a city where 40 percent of the population lives in poverty — switched the town’s water provider from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department to the Flint River in 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soon after, residents began complaining about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/20/465545378/lead-laced-water-in-flint-a-step-by-step-look-at-the-makings-of-a-crisis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;quality of the water&lt;/a&gt;, in particular its smell and color. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tests showed that the water had elevated levels of lead and trihalomethanes, cancer-causing disinfection byproducts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, the Flint River water made pipes &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.6b04034&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;corrode&lt;/a&gt;, exposing the people of Flint to harmful chemicals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three years later, Flint residents are still &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.helpforflint.com/residentresources/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;drinking and cooking with filtered or bottled water&lt;/a&gt; as their water supply continues to be tested for lead, copper, and chlorine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the very solution of bottled and filtered water also exacerbates the problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s not as much water flowing through the pipes, which makes them corrode faster,” says Mack. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Potentially deadly health impact&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lead exposure&lt;/a&gt; can affect nearly every system in the body.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lead-filled water affects everyone exposed to it, but the effects are exacerbated in children, the elderly, and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/materials/lead_and_your_health_508.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences&lt;/a&gt;, the effects of lead in children can include behavioral and attention-related issues, delayed puberty, impaired hearing, stunted growth, and decreased cognitive ability, IQ, and academic achievement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In adults, health effects can include hypertension, nerve disorders including tremors and other disorders of the central nervous system, decreased kidney function, and fertility problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Legionnaires’ disease, a form of pneumonia caused by &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt; bacteria, has so far caused the deaths of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/01/13/snyder-flint-area-has-seen-spike-legionnaires/78750610/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10 people&lt;/a&gt; in Flint. Between June 2014 and November 2015, 87 cases of the disease were reported to the county medical examiner’s office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jonathan Yoder, who works for the waterborne disease prevention branch of the CDC, says that Flint demonstrates the importance of water quality for communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If your water is of poor quality, it impacts every part of your community,” he told Healthline. “We have to ensure our water is safe, because it touches every part of our lives, in our homes and in our businesses, so it’s important that we can trust it to be supportive, not detrimental, to our health.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yoder points out that water is used not only for drinking but also for “handwashing, bathing, and recreational uses, not to mention the way it’s used in industry and agriculture.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It must therefore “be safe and clean and free from disease-causing organisms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A broad spectrum of disease&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’re used to hearing stories about water and sanitation issues in other countries, including China, India, Haiti, and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/health/cholera-vaccine-bangladesh.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; in The New York Times, cholera, a bacterial disease that “spurs the intestines to violently flush themselves” is “a continuing threat in nearly 70 countries, where more than 1 billion people are at risk.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cholera is a particularly serious effect of poor sanitation. Could an outbreak happen here?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most water bills — the ones an increasing number of people will not be able to afford in the near future — usually include water &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; sewage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If a significant number of people have their water shut off for nonpayment, it could lead to a dangerous hygiene situation in the cities and towns where water is unaffordable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And even in towns where residents can afford the increasing costs of water bills, they must still deal with outdated infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve not continued to invest in system upgrades and pipe replacements. As a result, we have an estimated 240,000 water main breaks a year that could potentially expose users to sewage, pathogens, and other contaminants,” says Michael Beach, PhD, the chief of the waterborne disease prevention branch at the CDC, in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/materials.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of now, cholera isn’t a primary concern for America’s water supply, according to CDC statistics. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t concerns at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, the top five causes of drinking water outbreaks are giardia, &lt;em&gt;Legionella&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shigella&lt;/em&gt;, norovirus, and &lt;em&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clean running water is critical for preventing disease outbreaks, but it’s also dangerous and inconvenient not to have it for everyday tasks such as hand-washing, teeth-brushing, cooking, and cleaning. Anyone who has traveled internationally — or, indeed, has visited Flint recently — can tell you how critical it is.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t take you very long to really miss the convenience of a faucet and being able to do things that were so easy and that we take for granted,” says Yoder. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Beyond Flint&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flint has brought home the issue of water quality to the 286 million Americans who get their water from public utilities that are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). An additional 45 million, or 15 percent to 20 percent, use private wells that &lt;a href=&quot;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/123/6/1599&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;aren’t regulated&lt;/a&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But “America's water issues extend far beyond Flint,” according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/24/americas-water-crisis-goes-beyond-flint-michigan.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;story on CNBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The outlet obtained data from the EPA that show only nine U.S. states have safe levels of lead in their water supply. Put another way, 41 states have reported “higher than acceptable levels of lead in drinking water.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If nothing else, the water troubles in Flint have shined a light on the problem of poor water quality and lead exposure nationwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;New York recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/nyregion/new-york-dept-education-lead-water.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;changed its water-testing protocol&lt;/a&gt; for schools and found levels of lead above the EPA’s recommended limits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cities across New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Ohio that have long battled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/02/04/untold-cities-across-america-have-higher-rates-of-lead-poisoning-than-flint/?utm_term=.b480169337ea&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;higher lead levels in children&lt;/a&gt;, primarily from lead-based paint, have new ammunition in advocating for more oversight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mack predicts confidently that the underlying reasons that Flint’s water was contaminated with chemicals and bacteria “will repeat elsewhere.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In most places, water infrastructure is old, and they have to go in and replace and update it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yoder concurs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“More than 100 years ago we began this process of separating our wastewater from our drinking water, and in general, we have really good water quality in the U.S.,” he says. “We’ve invested in having clean, safe water, and developing public water systems, and it’s made a huge impact on the health of our citizens. Whatever we can do to maintain and improve that infrastructure is really important.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The crisis continues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there’s no end in sight to Flint’s water crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Smithsonian magazine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/chemical-study-ground-zero-house-flint-water-crisis-180962030/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Flint is “now in the midst of an effort to replace the city's thousands of lead pipes, but it’s unclear how long it will take or how much it will end up costing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compounding the situation, the Trump administration recently placed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/01/23/trump-administration-tells-epa-to-freeze-all-grants-contracts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;freeze on grants and contracts&lt;/a&gt; from the EPA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flint and cities with similar poor water quality depend on such grants for money to help fix their water supply. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, Republicans in the House of Representatives recently &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/4657438/congressional-republicans-environmental-regulations-coal-streams/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reversed a rule&lt;/a&gt; that prevented coal mines from dumping their debris into nearby streams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time magazine quoted Republican Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as saying, “The stream protection rule is really just a thinly veiled attempt to wipe out coal mining jobs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Be prepared and get educated&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps surprisingly, there is no federal law ensuring the right to water for all people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The EPA regulations can’t entirely prevent old, outdated pipes from introducing toxic chemicals and pathogens into the water supply in an increasing number of cities with infrastructure dating back to World War II.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fixing the problem will require nothing less than a nationwide overhaul of our water and wastewater infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the meantime, both Yoder and Mack recommend getting educated about your water bill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yoder acknowledges that the future of water affordability and its impact on health “are the kinds of things that you could lie awake and worry about at night,” but says people’s energy is better spent learning about their water systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Where does their water come from? How do they know it’s safe? What are the systems in place to acquire that water: to treat it, to make sure it’s safe both at the treatment plant and all the way to their house? Are there things they can do to conserve water?” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mack advises people to “find out how much water you use every month, who your provider is, what your billing structure is, and whether you can install water-saving fixtures.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you’re having an affordability issue,” she says, “contact your provider and see if you can’t renegotiate payment of your bill.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For people who are in economic hardship, [water affordability] is a really challenging situation,” says Yoder. “But from a planning standpoint, it’s really important that we get involved and we understand water and value it as a common resource that we all need to survive.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From Flint to Philadelphia and Santa Fe to Seattle, clean, affordable water is an increasingly precious resource.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knowing why that is and what you can do about it could save your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Adam Barker first walked into a boutique fitness studio, he immediately noticed the difference from a public or big-box gym.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Everything is catered for you,” he said. “You're guaranteed quality in everything from the workout, to the equipment, to the amenities and facilities available to you — it’s like a nirvana for your fitness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like others who frequent trendy studios with an “exclusive club” feel — mood lighting, banging beats, and mirrors everywhere — Barker is more than willing to pay $30 or more for a single fitness class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m happy to spend a little bit more on the best quality experiences with extra personalized and tailored routines, and extras that make it special,” said Barker, chief executive officer and co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magnapass.co.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MagnaPass&lt;/a&gt;, a U.K.-based company that lets people book local fitness classes online.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Selling an experience&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Expensive fitness classes are not a new phenomenon, but right now they seem to be hot — hot enough to burn a hole in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In New York, for $34 a class you can experience the spin classes of SoulCycle or its competitor FlyWheel, or try out strength and interval training on a treadmill at Barry’s Bootcamp.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to shell out $37, you can take a drop-in “Pilates-meets-ballet” class at The Bar Method or get pumped and stretchy at Exhale’s CoreFusion yoga classes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the boutique fitness ceiling goes even higher.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SLT offers a Pilates and cardio mix done on M3 Megaformer machines, and Aqua takes spin classes into the pool. Both for $40 per class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, rates vary from city to city. And some studios offer deals or cheaper rates if you pay for more classes up front.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But compare this to regular gyms and you’ll see how quickly the cost of boutique fitness classes can add up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Planet Fitness and World Gym also offer fitness classes — plus a wide range of treadmills and strength training equipment — for membership fees of $10 to $20 a month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the higher end of the scale, the New York Health &amp;amp; Racquet Club — with weights, treadmills, swimming pool, basketball and racquetball courts, sauna, steam room, and more — charges up to $135 a month, plus a $300 initiation fee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the racquet club, that comes out to less than $2,000 a year — for unlimited access. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking three underwater spin classes a week at Aqua — to hit the recommended 150 minutes of cardio a week — would cost more than $6,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, working with a personal trainer once a week for $100 or $150 each session would run up to $7,800 a year — and that’s not counting any gym fees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hidden costs of fitness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt that part of what you’re paying for at boutique fitness studios is what Barker calls the “good atmosphere and those touches that give a studio that extra personality.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aryn Forman, owner of the small online boutique &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arynpayne.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aryn Payne&lt;/a&gt;, noticed this when she attended a SoulCycle class in the Boston area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is clean and has a very nice atmosphere,” she said. “They are selling fancy clothes and everything looks brand new.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some boutique fitness studios sell clothing and other merchandise embossed with their logos — sometimes funneling members through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2017/01/23/how-much-would-you-pay-to-work-out-at-an-instagram-worthy-gym.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gift shop&lt;/a&gt; after class to pick up some trendy supplies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And there are the free amenities like complimentary towels, deodorant, shampoo, hair ties, and earplugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But market forces also drive the higher class prices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People don’t realize what it costs for me to run Rise Nation,” Jason Walsh, founder of Rise Nation, a California-based studio that offers fitness classes on climber machines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You have to pay your people and hopefully pay them well,” added Walsh. “You’ve got overhead. And for real estate in West Hollywood — prime real estate — it’s thousands of dollars per month.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As expected from their image, many expensive boutique fitness studios are in trendy neighborhoods — with high rent costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like Rise Nation, they may also have high equipment costs just because of the classes they offer — like the stationary bicycles immersed in a pool at Aqua or the $7,000 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/fashion/sebastien-lagrees-megaformer-machines-put-the-sweat-in-pilates.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;M3 Megaformer machines&lt;/a&gt; at SLT and Studio Lagree. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And paying instructors to run each class is not cheap, especially when you want the best. Which is a big part of the experience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People get to know the instructor — who often teaches a lot of classes at the boutique studio — and they learn to like that person's teaching style and crave it,” said Ashley Pitt, a San Francisco-based personal trainer and author of the blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://aladygoeswest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Lady Goes West&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Most bang for the buck&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;No matter how many cold eucalyptus towels you get for free at a fitness studio, though, paying more for a class doesn’t always mean a better workout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So how do you find something that gives you the most bang for your buck?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“To get the best results,” said Justin Fauci, a certified personal trainer, and co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://leanmuscleproject.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lean Muscle Project&lt;/a&gt;, “choose classes that focus on one primary goal — such as maximizing strength via weight training, or maximizing calorie burn via high-intensity spinning.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Variety is good, too, so you don’t hit a fitness plateau or get bored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pitt recommends finding classes “that have a different focus each day, in order to work new muscles. Orangetheory Fitness and Barry's Bootcamp are great at this because they keep the participant guessing so that you have to keep working harder and differently each time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, watch out for classes that try to cram everything into one workout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Doing cardio alongside strength training tends to dilute the effectiveness of the strength training by draining your energy and limiting the amount of weight you can lift,” said Fauci.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These types of classes are common among fitness studios chasing the latest craze.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately what you’re seeing in these ‘hybrid classes’ — where there’s two or three different aspects to the workout — is just somebody putting their hand in a grab bag, throwing it against the wall, and seeing what sticks,” said Walsh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Find a class that fits your goals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether a fitness class works for you also depends on your goals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With spin classes, you can always pedal faster or harder than those around you for a more intense workout.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Fauci said some group classes may take a one-size-fits-all approach to strength training, where you work with the same weight the entire time, or do low weights and high reps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This may help build endurance, but not size or strength.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If building muscle and strength is one of your primary fitness goals,” said Fauci, “then I believe that most fitness classes are going to be a waste of your money — and your time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The importance of matching the workout to your goals is true for other areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For clients focused on weight loss, TRX, kettlebell, HIIT [high-intensity interval training], and boot camp style classes are the biggest bang for your buck,” said New York-based certified personal trainer Lisa Snow, president of &lt;a href=&quot;http://onthemendfitness.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;On the Mend Customized Fitness and Massage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But if you need to let go of some stress or improve your mobility, she added, yoga, stretching, or MELT foam roller classes would be a better use of your time and money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Balance is good, too — not just the kind you get from standing on one leg in yoga class.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.acsm.org/about-acsm/media-room/news-releases/2011/08/01/acsm-issues-new-recommendations-on-quantity-and-quality-of-exercise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt; recommends that in addition to at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week, most adults should also include strength training and flexibility exercises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are just starting out, though, do whatever it takes to make exercise a regular part of your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the foundation is there, it’s time to balance your workouts, rather than wasting money by focusing only on your strengths — and ignoring your weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you're already running outside every day, do you really need a spin class?” said Snow. “You've already got so much cardio under your belt. Pilates or yoga might be a better investment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For stress-free and flexible yoga fans, said Snow, a dumbbell or kettlebell class might be a good option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Put the workout first&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the lighting and music, Rise Nation still has a bit of a trendy club feel, but all that, said Walsh, is secondary to helping people get great results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I came up with a really efficient and effective and safe workout. That was it,” he said. “That was the seed that started this whole thing. It wasn’t the other way around.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said he spent a couple of years in the studio, where he does personal training, coming up with the workout before even opening up shop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And with only 31 climbers in the room, Rise Nation classes are smaller than some packed stadium fitness classes. This helps instructors keep an eye on students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I want people to have great form,” said Walsh. “That’s really important to me.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Snow sets the bar even higher — or lower — for class size.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Skip the expensive classes with 20, 30, or 40 people in the room,” she said. “While they may have better music or decor than a chain gym, it's hard to see how these classes are really better than free classes that come with a gym membership.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s the ideal boutique class size to justify the higher price and allow the instructor the focus on you? Snow puts it at 12 or fewer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finding an instructor that you connect with is also essential if you plan on returning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A great instructor is one who can help you push past comfort in a motivating and supportive environment,” said Donnie Stutland, co-owner of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wheelpowerstudio.com/&quot;&gt;WheelPower Studio&lt;/a&gt; in Illinois. “It's easy to have an easy workout at home and not realize how little we have truly pushed ourselves.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Don’t ignore cheaper options &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Expensive boutique fitness studios don’t have a monopoly on good workouts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rise Nation’s classes are $26. In New York, on average, Bikram yoga classes are $25, and Jivamukti yoga classes are $22.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;WheelPower Studio charges $23 for a class. But like many studios, they also offer monthly pricing to keep the cost lower. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And they have two studios under the same roof for more workout options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People can take a cycle class one day, a bootcamp or rhythmic sculpt class the next, and yoga to round out the week, as opposed to getting the exact same workout in every class as at many boutiques,” said Stutland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we’re approaching big-box gym territory. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which is not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The great thing is that I pay one month and I'm able to take as many classes as I want,” said New York-based comedian Dan Nainan, who is a member of the New York Health &amp;amp; Racquet Club.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You certainly can't beat that. Studio classes in New York are really expensive,” he added. “So to me, it's a no-brainer.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cheaper fitness options can also help people exercise regularly — not just when they can afford it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If someone is struggling to afford boutique classes,” said Pitt. “I think they would be well served to see what is available at the big-box gym near them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As surprising as it may seem to diehard fans of boutique fitness classes, not everyone who tries them is rushing back.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“SoulCycle was a good experience. It was definitely fun but super hard,” said Forman. “But I didn't feel like it was a superior experience to other fitness classes I have taken.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others even swear by the variety offered at large gyms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With his monthly membership, Nainan has taken kickboxing, trampoline, yoga, and core strength classes — and has hardly noticed any difference from what’s offered at boutique studios.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I took karate classes for years and essentially it's a bunch of people in a room along with an instructor,” said Nainan. “I don't really know how many ways there are to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Jury is Still Out on Benefits of Moderate Drinking

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/021717_moderatedrinking_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is a glass of red wine every night really beneficial for your health?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe. Maybe not. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the ever-raging debate over alcohol consumption, many experts cite the supposed benefits moderate drinking can have on cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tim Stockwell, PhD, director of the Centre for Addictions Research of British Columbia, in Canada, used to be one of those experts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many years ago he wrote a commentary in which he suggested it would be ridiculous to doubt that alcohol in moderation was cardioprotective. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, however, Stockwell considers his prior assertions embarrassing and is unconvinced that alcohol is beneficial to cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m skeptical as to whether there are any benefits,” Stockwell told Healthline. “I’m now not at all sure there is any cardioprotection, so I believe such advice would be potentially dangerous.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) &lt;a href=&quot;https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-9/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; defines moderate drinking as up to one drink per day for women and two for men. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, a standard drink is considered to contain 14 grams of ethanol, the amount found in 12 ounces of 5 percent alcohol by volume (ABV) beer, or 5 ounces of 12 percent ABV wine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Short-term and long-term risk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2016/02/29/CIRCULATIONAHA.115.019743&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health showed that there was an immediate cardiovascular risk after drinking, but researchers noted moderate consumption may not have a long-term risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There appears to be a consistent finding of an immediately higher risk of heart attacks and strokes following any alcohol consumption, but by 24 hours only heavy alcohol intake conferred a continued heightened risk,” Elizabeth Mostofsky, ScD, instructor at Harvard, and lead researcher of the study, told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In other words, heavy drinking increases risk both in the short term and the long term, but drinking smaller amounts has different effects in the subsequent hours than it does in the subsequent days and weeks. It seems possible that the transiently higher cardiovascular risk in the hours after drinking small amounts of alcohol may be outweighed by the longer-term health benefits or regular drinking,” she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;George F. Koob, PhD, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, says there have been studies that suggest a potential health benefit to alcohol in moderate amounts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Animal and human laboratory studies suggest that alcohol increases HDL [“good” cholesterol], lowers LDL [“bad” cholesterol], decreases blood pressure, decreases inflammation, decreases &lt;a href=&quot;/health/atherosclerosis&quot;&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, decreases diabetic vasculopathy [disease of blood vessels], and increases protective signaling against I/R induced tissue damage [involved in ischemic stroke], among others,” Koob told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Other methods&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Koob suggests that the possible health benefits of alcohol could be obtained through other means. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Many of the potential benefits of alcohol can be achieved through a healthy diet and exercise. And low-risk drinking doesn’t mean no-risk drinking. So it’s really a personal choice,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the red wine, Stockwell says there is no known health benefit to having a glass every night. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Wine drinkers sometimes look better than other people in these kinds of studies, but that appears most likely to be due to a range of confounders,” he told Healthline. “People who like wine tend to have a whole host of other lifestyle characteristics compared with those who drink beer, for example, which generally mean they have more protective factors unrelated to their drinking, e.g., being relatively wealthy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;So, what should you do?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So where does this leave people unsure about whether or not alcohol is good for them in moderate amounts? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Koob, one should consider whether the benefits of drinking outweigh the risks. Are they taking medications that interact with alcohol? Are they pregnant, planning to be pregnant, or breastfeeding? Is there is a history of alcohol dependence in the family? Are they able to keep their drinking within the low-risk guidelines? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is important to consider carefully any risks, if possible, in concert with your physician, when deciding whether or not to consume alcohol,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Koob notes that a person may choose to drink in moderation for a social benefit. However, there are no definitive answers regarding possible health benefits of moderate consumption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those unsure if they should introduce alcohol into their diet, the American Dietary Guidelines do not recommend that individuals who do not drink alcohol start drinking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with many matters relating to health, the risks and benefits of alcohol are largely dependent on the individual and as such it is hard for experts to make a broad recommendation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The blanket statement I’m comfortable with is that alcohol presents a risk to the health of everyone who drinks it, but in proportion to how much they drink, and starting at a very low level,” Stockwell said. “Enjoy moderate drinking if you are a moderate drinker, but don’t kid yourself it’s doing any good healthwise. Be aware of the risks and try to limit the number of days you drink and stick within the drinking guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Is Swimming the Best Exercise for Children with Asthma?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/021717_asthmaswim_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s cold outside, which means it can be difficult to get anyone, let alone kids, up off the couch to exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if your child has asthma that can present concerns.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the United States, asthma affects 1 in 11 children, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/asthma/impacts_nation/asthmafactsheet.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Center for Disease Control (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;. And a cold, dry winter can make these youngsters even more susceptible to the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the airways — or bronchial tubes — inside the lungs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What can be problematic for children with asthma is how exercise, or any kind of strenuous activity — games of tag or school soccer matches — can affect the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With asthma a person’s airways are always inflamed to some degree, so exercise can lead to a more acute and serious condition known as exercise-induced asthma (EID) or exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tod Olin, a pediatric pulmonary specialist at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nationaljewish.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Jewish Health&lt;/a&gt;, explains: “[As] you exercise, you breathe more, as you breathe more the air in the airways is moving back and forth and it evaporates some of the water that is naturally lining your airways. This process of drying leads to the muscle squeezing down and causing the airflow limitation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Indoor pools an option&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what, if anything, can a parent do to keep a child with asthma up and active?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Olin and others say swimming at an indoor pool can be a great physical activity for children with asthma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among other things, the presence of humidity is helpful for alleviating the dryness in the airways typically associated with cardiovascular exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you can prevent the water loss, by being in a really humid environment, the chances of having a problem go down,” Olin told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tonya Winders, president and chief executive officer of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allergyasthmanetwork.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Allergy &amp;amp; Asthma Network&lt;/a&gt;, echoes that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She told Healthline that humid environments such as steam rooms are commonly used to help people with bronchoconstriction to relax and open up the airways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Swimming also holds additional benefits for kids with asthma, due to the nature of the exercise itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By holding their breath, children not only help to expand their lung capacity, but also gain a greater &lt;a href=&quot;http://njhealth.multimedia-newsroom.com/index.php/2017/02/07/why-you-should-enroll-your-child-with-asthma-in-swimming-classes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ability to control their breathing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though, as with any other exercise, some preventative measures should be taken to minimize the possibility of an asthma attack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Winders and Olin suggest that children pretreat with a few puffs of their short-acting asthma medication before beginning their exercise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, swimming is just another option for kids to get out and move their bodies. It certainly isn’t the only activity for children with asthma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Anything every other healthy child can do, a child with asthma should be able to do if their symptoms are well-controlled,” says Winders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Olin agrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We definitely don’t want to give the message, ‘Don’t do something because you have asthma,’ because something like 30 percent of Olympic athletes have asthma,” he said. “You can do anything you want with asthma, for the most part.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What about the chlorine?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chlorine doesn’t have a significant impact on asthma symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is true that when chlorine comes in contact with human waste — be it sweat or urine — it can form chemicals known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/aquatics-professionals/chloramines.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chloramines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s those chloramines, not the chlorine itself, responsible for causing irritation in the eyes and respiratory tract.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“[The] relative risk that we can attribute to [chlorine] in 2017 is really, really low,” said Olin. “So, the benefit of getting someone out and exercising, especially if they like to swim, outweighs the theoretic risk of the chlorine.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Winders does caution that asthma and potential interactions with irritants such as chlorine must be treated on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It really depends on the person and their individual triggers as to what makes their asthma worse,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Reynolds Vapor Company&lt;/a&gt;, a subsidiary of the tobacco giant Reynolds America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;British American Tobacco (BAT), the largest tobacco company in the Europe, launched &lt;a href=&quot;http://vaperanks.com/europes-largest-tobacco-cigarette-maker-launches-its-own-e-cigarette/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vype&lt;/a&gt; around four years ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Altria (formerly Phillip Morris) owns &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/08/04/altria-group-inc-and-philip-morris-international-i.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MarkTen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lorillard paid $135 million for Blu, but when R.J. Reynolds &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-tobacco-reynolds-lorrilard-20140715-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bought&lt;/a&gt; that tobacco company in 2015, its e-cigarette brand was sold to Imperial Tobacco, a company in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, global e-cigarette sales amount to around &lt;a href=&quot;https://quitsmokingcommunity.org/what-is-vaping/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$5 billion&lt;/a&gt; a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That compares to the $92 million cigarette market, but the e-cigarette industry is expected to grow &lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2014/06/10/e-cigarette-sales-rising/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;24 percent&lt;/a&gt; per year through 2018.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Big Tobacco is now dominating in dollars in sales,” Drope said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Firms funding e-cigarette research&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tobacco industry appears so confident in the technology that they are now funding research that looks at the health effects of e-cigarettes vs. regular cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/aivt.2016.0024&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt;, funded by British American Tobacco used 3-D modeling to compare the inflammation in the lungs from e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study, published in Applied In Vitro Toxicology, showed a dramatic drop in lung inflammation with e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Researchers reported changes in the expression levels of 123 genes when reconstituted lung tissue was exposed to cigarette smoke, compared to only two genes that could be confirmed following exposure to e-cigarette aerosols,” according to a press release. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These finding are similar to what initial research has uncovered about e-cigarettes. A small batch of studies do suggest that they pose less of a health threat than regular cigarettes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“From a cancer perspective, the levels of carcinogens are lower,” Drope said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BAT did not provide comment for this story. R.J. Reynolds also declined to be interviewed, but did provide a statement:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We believe that vapor products and other noncombustible tobacco products may present less risk to adult tobacco consumers than smoking cigarettes. Although these products have not been used by consumers for a sufficient period of time to develop definitive scientific conclusions about their level of risk reduction, there is a growing body of scientific evidence that these products may present less risk than smoking. While some studies report that there may be health risks associated with these products, those risks appear to be lower than the risks of smoking cigarettes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Health concerns abound&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many unknowns about the health hazards of e-cigarettes, and that’s what has groups such as the ALA and ACS concerned. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Being less deadly than regular cigarettes does not make your product less safe to use,” Sward said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First up is the use of aerosol in e-cigarettes and the impact on the body’s pulmonary and cardiovascular systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t know the long-term effects,” Drope said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aside from the health issues, the biggest concern about e-cigarettes are the users themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Surgeon General said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://e-cigarettes.surgeongeneral.gov/documents/2016_SGR_Fact_Sheet_508.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that, “among young adults 18-24 years of age, e-cigarette use more than doubled from 2013 to 2014. As of 2014, more than one-third of young adults had tried e-cigarettes.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sward said the trend is troubling for a number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There is a strong association between e-cigs, cigarettes, and other burned tobacco products by young people,” she said “There is not a safe level of nicotine use for kids until the age of 24.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In December 2016, the FDA did establish some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fda.gov/TobaccoProducts/Labeling/RulesRegulationsGuidance/ucm394909.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; governing the sale and distribution of e-cigarettes. They can’t be sold to anyone under 18. Buyers need to show proof of identification. E-cigarettes also can’t be sold in vending machines (unless in an adult-only facility), and they can’t be distributed for free. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both the ALA and ACS would like the FDA to impose even stricter rules, such as warning labels and an advertising ban in magazines and billboards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Kids are very much reacting to the advertising,” Drope said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sward said the flavors are another big draw to kids and the FDA hasn’t done anything to regulate those.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both say it’s hard to tell what will happen around e-cigarettes, now that there is a new administration in the White House. Drope believes a lot depends on where the e-cigarette market industry expects to be in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I can imagine them being a niche market. I can see them being just another product,” he said. “If tobacco industry decides to throw their might behind it, I could really see them taking off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
t;p&gt;Since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law on March 23, 2010, 20 million people have signed up for health insurance coverage through the federal or state marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, experiences with the ACA and the healthcare coverage it provides vary greatly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Income, location, and overall health can influence how well the ACA works for many people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We asked three Americans who purchased health insurance through the Obamacare system to tell us about their coverage and their experiences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name/Age/Location: &lt;/strong&gt;Noel Green, 28, Gary, Ind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation:&lt;/strong&gt; Health Benefits Navigator&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual Income: &lt;/strong&gt;$28,000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What level (bronze, silver, gold) of ACA coverage do you have, and how much do you pay per month? Is it just for you or your family? Did you qualify for a subsidy?&lt;/strong&gt; My present coverage is silver. The amount that I pay monthly is $89. It’s just me. I do qualify for a subsidy. My actual monthly payment is $200-something, but then the ACA subsidy comes in and covers a large portion of that, so I only pay $89.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Did you have health insurance prior to the ACA? If yes, what type of coverage and what did you pay? Did it cover your needs?&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve had insurance through employers before. My present employer does not offer health insurance, so I wasn’t able to get it. All of my previous employers before coming into the field of public health, I was covered under my own plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Politics aside, what is your opinion of the ACA coverage that you actually use? Does it meet your specific needs?&lt;/strong&gt; It does meet my needs. Some of the issues that I’ve had, understanding the nature of the issue that I deal with [he is HIV-positive], makes it very much so necessary for me to have insurance. If I do not have a job, [the ACA] makes it easier to find coverage, but if I am employed, it’s very difficult to have coverage that enables me to meet all of my healthcare needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just in my previous jobs, I needed the help of copay cards, and then my physician kind of supported me with extra medication in order to just remain healthy and adherent. With the ACA, I see that as being something that is a continuation of a problem. I’m still doing the same thing. There’s no special circumstance, understanding that once they do have some sort of understanding from my provider about the nature of the illness that I deal with, that there’s no extra support, if you will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are different state-provided programs that pay the monthly premium, but that is only offered in certain states. Like in the state of Illinois, they pay the premium monthly if you do have ACA coverage, but I’m a resident of Indiana. It’s a completely different system, and they do not cover your ACA premiums.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On top of that, my out-of-pocket cost for my first medication was $867. If I did not have a copay card from the drug manufacturer, I would not have been able to get my meds. Because my doctor was able to assist me with that, I was able to get my medication. So there is a hole, if you will, in support for people who are one: employed, and two: HIV-positive and trying to navigate the terrain of trying to be healthy. The ACA doesn’t really offer any type of coverage for that hole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our medications are considered to be specialty. There is no extra support in the gold plan that would not have us pay a huge out-of-pocket cost for those medications. It’s all based on income, but the gold plans would make it so that my meds would be $3, and my out-of-pocket maximum would be very low. The total monthly cost would be upward of $300 or $400, and my monthly cost would be $150 each month, which would not be sustainable for me. I have to move things around and get things together and work in connection with my provider and the drug manufacturer and case management in order to just maintain good health. I want to survive, so I do it, but it’s a hassle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Are you aware of the consumer protections that came with the health law such as covering preexisting conditions, preventative care costs, birth control, etc.?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I’m aware of the preventative care. A lot of the going to get checkups and blood tests, their definition of “preventative” on my end, for a person dealing with my issue, that does nothing for me. The wellness check, checking my blood pressure and things like that, that’s wonderful. They pay for that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the necessary component of preventative care that is a part of my situation are lab tests, which constitutes CD4 count, T cells, checking out how my liver is functioning, how my kidneys are doing because of the nature of the toxins I’m putting inside my body. Those things are not covered at 100 percent. They’re considered to just be regular support, so again, that’s that hole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My preventive procedures are not considered preventive. The wellness check, that’s wonderful, and I do appreciate that. That’s something I do need to take care of as well, but the necessary components of the major issue that I face, those things aren’t covered at 100 percent, and I still end up having to pay a component of those exams in order to just be healthy and just know that I’m healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Should the law be completely overturned or should the government find way to improve it?&lt;/strong&gt; I do not think the law should be overturned. I’m completely against that. The quality of life that I see for the regular, everyday American is enhanced by the system of the Affordable Care Act. I believe that there may be some issues that need to be modified in order to be sustainable long term. But do away with it? No.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If they did do away with it, I would be a person that would be without coverage. Because of the Affordable Care Act, somebody who has a preexisting condition going out to seek coverage can get it. I would basically be turned down everywhere I went because I do have a preexisting condition. Then on top of that, in reference to just having a better quality of life because I have health insurance, that wouldn’t be attainable if they took [the ACA] away. I’m all for whatever is broken, we fix it, but I’m not for throwing it away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Are you better or worse off than you were before the ACA became law? &lt;/strong&gt;I’m definitely better off because of the ACA. I feel like in my present situation if it was not for the ACA, my quality of life would be, it wouldn’t be at the level with which I’m happy. Just knowing what’s going on inside of my body and being able to go to my doctor and get the tests run that need to be run in order for me to understand that my medication is effective is important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plus, as a result of the medication, there are some things that I have to deal with. My liver function could be diminished, but that’s like a thin line my doctors need to study over time so I don’t have another problem later on. I have to make sure that not just now, but in 10 years from now, my quality of life is good. That’s what [the ACA] allows me to do — to have a good quality of life today but also in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Should the U.S. government be responsible for providing healthcare to its citizens? Is healthcare insurance a basic human right?&lt;/strong&gt; I do feel that because of the nature of the government itself, it’s meant to meet the needs and regulatory expectations of the populace. With that being said, I am not a minority in my need for coverage of issues that in previous years would have left me unhealthy with basically very bad quality of life. With that being said, I firmly believe that the government is responsible for providing a level of care or assuring that there is health coverage available to meet the needs of all citizens in this country, and that they, in this capacity that they are providing it, that it is an exact response to meet the need in an effective way for many people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I do say that the government should be responsible for that. If we were a country that we were able to have the cost of healthcare at a level which was sustainable for the average, everyday American that’s working a minimum wage job to pay for their own insurance and still have a great quality of life without the help of the government, then I would say “No.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the cost of maintaining a good quality of life and being healthy is high, so the government needs to intervene in that process to make sure that our basic right of being healthy, of maintaining a good quality of life, is protected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Other thoughts on the ACA?&lt;/strong&gt; I feel like there needs to be some extra. All the plans are not HIV-friendly. That is a problem in itself. Even if it’s a lesser quality, there should be some type of universal expectation in reference to this particular issue for people who are trying to maintain independence in their lives and maintain a quality of life that they can support themselves on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There should be some universality on the coverage of medication. There should not be this fractured understanding between insurance plans where if you’re on this insurance plan and you have a high out-of-pocket cost, but you’re left high and dry. But if you’re paying more for coverage, your medications are paid at a higher rate. There needs to be a universal concept on the HIV medication because that in itself makes it that much more difficult as a person going in and saying I need health coverage and having to comb through all the plans. I have to decide do I want the medicine covered at 100 percent and just be broke most of the time, or do I want something that gives me good coverage all around but doesn’t cover all of my meds 100 percent and then navigate through the system to find additional resources that are out there. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name/Age/Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Leanne Bryson, 63, Sacramento, Calif.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation:&lt;/strong&gt; Retired&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual Income:&lt;/strong&gt; Fixed income from savings&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What level (bronze, silver, gold) of ACA coverage do you have and how much do you pay per month? Is it just for you or your family? Did you qualify for a subsidy?&lt;/strong&gt; We have gold. We would have to be paying $2,681, but we get a subsidy. Our subsidy is $1,417, so our out-of-pocket is roughly $1,264 per month for the two of us. So we can keep our subsidy, we pull from our retirement at less than $62,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Did you have health insurance prior to the ACA? If yes, what type of coverage, and what did you pay? Did it cover your needs?&lt;/strong&gt; We did, through my husband’s employer. It was excellent coverage. We had UnitedHealthcare, and it was top of the line. We chose to go with the best you could have. His was free, totally free. His company paid for his, and I want to say mine was $90 per month. It was fairly inexpensive. We used COBRA for the 18 months, and our COBRA payment for UnitedHealthcare was $1,830 per month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Politics aside, what is your opinion of the ACA coverage that you actually use? Does it meet your specific needs?&lt;/strong&gt; It has so far. We have gold, so we have the best that you can get in our market. When we came off COBRA and I called eHealth.com to get our coverage, I explained to the representative what we needed, what our health is — my husband and I are in relatively good health. We take a couple of prescriptions and see our doctor twice a year so we have pretty normal needs, but I also knew I needed to have surgery at the beginning of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[The eHealth.com representative] directed us toward the gold plan, and I’m pretty pleased thus far. I’ve been on this since the first of the year. I’ve had surgery already. I had my gall bladder removed, and I had a small umbilical hernia. As the final bills are coming in, we’re going to pay out-of-pocket a little less than $500. That includes the anesthesiologist, the outpatient, the surgeon, and follow-up care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Are you aware of the consumer protections that came with health law such as covering preexisting conditions, preventative care costs, birth control, etc.? &lt;/strong&gt;So obviously preexisting condition was important to me because I had this condition going before the first of the year. I knew going into this that I had to be covered well because I had to get this taken care of. I would prefer not to live with the pain. I knew this was coming up, so I was thankful for the preexisting condition coverage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Should the law be completely overturned or should the government find a way to improve it?&lt;/strong&gt; I think there’s huge room for improvement. I would prefer for myself a cafeteria plan where I can go in and choose the important things for my husband and me. With our previous healthcare plan through my husband’s company, we could do that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We also had a healthcare savings plan. I don’t know that I want the government being my savings account, but I would like maybe something possibly along those lines as a private savings account for bigger things that happen along the way because you never know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I would prefer not to pay for women’s reproductive benefits because it doesn’t affect me. I had a hysterectomy 20 years ago. It’s not something I need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t like to pay for pediatric dental or pediatric healthcare. I don’t have kids. My kid is 39 years old, and she has her own healthcare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are parts of it that I don’t appreciate having to pay for. And if I were able to change it to something that’s truly more affordable, in our case, we can only pull $62,000 a year, which sounds like a lot of money. However, after taxes, that’s only $48,000 a year that we live on. Now $1,200 a month comes off the top of that for our healthcare, so when all is said and done, we have about $32,000 we live on a year in the state of California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The frustrating part of the whole thing is we saved all of our adult lives for our retirement. When our raises came through, we put half of it into our 401k. We’ve always made sure we had our 401ks and our IRAs. There were years that we forewent vacation so we could save for retirement. So when we retired we really thought that we would have much more freedom in our own money that we could spend, but we can’t. If we go over, we’re going to get hammered with that higher rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Are you better or worse off than you were before the ACA became law? &lt;/strong&gt;I think that we’re better off as far as the insurance is concerned, but being restricted on what we can pull from the retirement is going to make life different for us. We have to budget our money much differently now. We don’t have the disposable income that we had. We have to budget gift giving to our grandkids. We have to budget if we go out to eat. If we do any extra spending, we have to take that into consideration. Part of the reason we retired early was so that we could travel while we’re still healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Should the U.S. government be responsible for providing healthcare to its citizens? Is healthcare insurance a basic human right?&lt;/strong&gt; That’s kind of a loaded question. There’s a role the government should play. It should be available to people who need it. It’s not something that should be done for free.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I have a bigger problem with “everything should be given.” I think that everything is eventually paid for. Either I’m paying for it with my taxes, or I’m paying for it out-of-pocket. I don’t necessarily agree that the government should be in the business of insuring. That’s not their job. That’s not the job that I see government having.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Other thoughts on the ACA?&lt;/strong&gt; I think that going through eHealth.com made it easier for us. I called early enough in the middle or beginning of December and explained to the representative what I needed, what was important to us, that I would have to gallbladder surgery after the first of the year. I said I’ll give you a week, so you come up with your best efforts and email me the plans so I can take a look for myself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within a couple of hours, I had two plans sitting in my inbox. He called me back a week later, we discussed it a little further, and this turned out to be the best plan for us. eHealth got us our dental [coverage] as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than going on the open market and trying to dive through all that stuff by yourself, you’re much better off going through whoever is available. eHealth was available to us; it was recommended to us by our financial advisor. I felt like I had a very good advocate with eHealth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If I could change anything about the Affordable Care Act, I feel like it needs to be post tax because I feel like I’m being taxed doubly for this. If it could be after taxes, it makes more sense to me. I’m getting taxed when I pull this money. I’m being taxed again when I use this benefit in essence. So it should be post-tax. It makes more sense to me, especially with how bad we’re getting hammered with this. The next year and a half to two years is going to be interesting for us. It’s not the retirement we envisioned, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name/Age/Location:&lt;/strong&gt; Jeff Wilson, 49, Athens, Ohio&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation:&lt;/strong&gt; Television Host, Author, and Video Producer&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Annual Income:&lt;/strong&gt; $60,000-$70,000&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. What level (bronze, silver, gold) of ACA coverage do you have and how much do you pay per month? Is it just for you or your family? Did you qualify for a subsidy? &lt;/strong&gt;We have bronze level. The bronze level is an HSA, a health savings account. Our deductible is $12,800 for the family. That’s total out-of-pocket, excepting premiums each year. We pay, for the four of us — I have a wife and two teenage daughters — $304 per month. We do get a subsidy because our income is where it is. I don’t know exactly what the subsidy is this year, but it typically runs between $600 and $700 per month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Did you have health insurance prior to the ACA? If yes, what type of coverage, and what did you pay? Did it cover your needs? &lt;/strong&gt;It didn’t cover our needs, but we hoped that we would be covered so we wouldn’t be ruined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a young actor in my 20s, I did enough work through the union — you only needed to make like $7,500 per year and then they would pay for health insurance for you and your family. I had a couple of years in my late 20s and early 30s when I got a few commercials and did well for a few years. Nicely enough, of those three years, two of those years are years in which I had children. I had full coverage with minimal deductibles the years that we had both of our children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, other years, when I didn’t qualify and I wasn’t making that much money, we just didn’t have coverage. Of course we thought, our health insurance is the fact that we are very healthy people — we work out, we eat organic food — except that the year between having our first daughter and our second daughter, my wife, who is very athletic, broke her wrist in a softball game. We had both of our cars die in the same week. Basically, within 10 days, we ran up almost $12,000 in bills for a person who, in my freelance career, made about $25,000 a year. We lived too close to the edge at that point. We were very frugal people, but that was a wake-up call. I basically went out and got a job painting full time for a friend until I could pay off our $12,000 worth of debt on top of my other job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I realized I had to do something. I went to an agent. They said, “Hey, you don’t need healthcare. Don’t prepay for healthcare.” That’s what most people do. If they don’t go to their doctor, they’re paying for care they never use. They said, “What you need is to not lose your home. You can deal with $12,000, but say it was $50,000? What would have happened?” Well, I would have lost my house. He convinced me that the high deductible with a health saving plan was a way that I could use our health as part of our equity and build an account that could eventually pay that deductible at $12,800. I was pretty young, probably early 30s when I signed up for that. We could only put a little bit of money away. It was probably four or five years before I could put away that first $13,000 for the deductible. I kind of focused on that because I wanted to make sure that we were safe for, I wanted a three-year pad. At this rate, if someone broke an arm or a leg in my house, I would pay for it out-of-pocket. I could deal with that financial hit, no problem. I would take on extra work or whatever. But, if one of us got cancer or needed a liver transplant, it could sink us.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back then, in my early 20s, I was only paying $220 or $240 per month. It hasn’t gone up that much. Right before ACA, I was paying in the $300 range. On that front, the ACA didn’t change much. Except that the coverage got much, much better. Before the ACA, my insurance had $1 million lifetime maximums per person. I bought this to have insurance so I wouldn’t lose my house or my cars or my business. But if I needed a liver transplant, a million dollars will not cover it. Once you have a transplant, you’re talking well over a million dollars, and we would still lose everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I had been paying for insurance that only kind of covered me. Plus, we had no preventive care, so we were not going for well visits until we really had to or felt like we should. We would take the kids in or we would rely on friends who were doctors to do their sports physicals and things like that, but we never went in for preventative healthcare. Things like mammograms and gynecological visits are expensive. My wife’s 53, I’m 50, and we’re in colonoscopy age. We’re talking a couple grand to have that done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What Obamacare did for us was say you can still have the insurance that you were getting, but now we’re going to insist that the insurance companies make that care worthwhile because before, quite honestly, it wasn’t. It would have cost my health insurance far more, if I had gotten sick, rather than just pay to have me looked at every year for preventive care. Our care just got a lot better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that I’m 50, I use the HSA deposit as a way of mitigating my adjusted gross income. I can put the full $6,750 amount into that account, and it’s taking off my income before I report my adjusted gross income. It goes in tax-free. It comes out tax-free assuming you use it for healthcare, and it grows tax-free. It’s a good investment. For someone like me — I am not wealthy, I’m solidly middle class if you look at the numbers — that health savings account is a really good, inexpensive way to keep your money from going to the insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I was worried that the HSA was going to go away. They talked about that one point with Obamacare. That would have upset me because I would have paid a lot more. I would have had to buy in at a higher level. Or I would have to buy a bronze plan, but there would be no way for saving for it. I would have to save individually for it. It wouldn’t be tax-free. I could still do that, but I would have to pay taxes on that money, so there’s less encouragement to do that. That works for me. That would not work for someone who has a chronic illness or traumatic illness. Nobody can take a $12,000 to $13,000 deductible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But for most of us, what that deductible does, it makes us a better healthcare consumer. Instead of just going whenever we want — they get their insurance through their work, they don’t think about it, they just go, and they consume a lot of services that they don’t need. We have to do things like ask how much things cost. I need to know the price ahead of time. Even though it’s something that’s supposed to be covered, in case there might be some small print and it’s not, I need to know so I can be prepared to pay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Politics aside, what is your opinion of the ACA coverage that you actually use? Does it meet your specific needs?&lt;/strong&gt; The coverage that we use — we’ve been in for our well visits, my wife for a colonoscopy recently, and I’ll be going in soon — it’s all been great. We are able to choose doctors that we like. We actually go to a sports medicine facility because we’re fit people, and we kind of find that people where we live in southeastern Ohio, people are generally not fit, so the advice that we hear from doctors, it doesn’t fit our body types. They’re not used to treating people like us. We go to the sports doctors because I run 20 miles a week and hike about 20 miles per week, and my wife is similarly active, so our aches and pains are different than other people. We go up to Columbus, which is about a one-hour drive, to a sports medicine facility to do our preventive care once a year. We have great doctors that we like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m a center-left progressive, and I did vote for Obama. I canvassed for Obama. I did vote and canvas for Hillary Clinton. But I’m happy to be critical of Obamacare because there are things wrong with it. There’s no doubt that the ACA was not a finished product, and I don’t think even Obama said that. My first experience was getting through that website. Getting signed up, there were so many errors. I had to go back so many times and talk to so many people on the phone that it took literally eight or nine months to sort the problems out. And this was after the website was up and quote-working-unquote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But that was the end of it. At this point, it’s really easy. The site works really great. We’re in Ohio, so we go through the marketplace. I go in, I check out the plans, change up the information during the enrollment period. It’s really easy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In terms of the other problems with it, are there people who pay more? It’s possible. I think most of the people who pay more don’t realize their coverage was really bad before. The objection that people don’t want an individual mandate — there are extremely inexpensive plans for individuals. I can’t imagine anyone will pay more than $100 per month for a bronze HSA for an individual person. For someone to complain that that’s a burden, you’d have to be really poor, and in that case, you’d be on Medicaid. We insist that everyone has car insurance, and everyone seems OK with that, but when we insist that everyone has health insurance, everyone gets up in arms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Are you aware of the consumer protections that came with health law such as covering preexisting conditions, preventative care costs, birth control, etc.?&lt;/strong&gt; I am aware because, for example, I wasn’t sure how things, like the colonoscopy, were covered. Until recently, I was not aware of the fact that women’s coverage, because there are three women in my family, is pretty good. You get a preventative checkup with your regular doctor, but then you get a gynecological visit. Pap smears are covered, and mammograms at certain times are covered, so I’m aware of those things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But we really consume so little healthcare at this point. We choose not to go to the doctor when we’re sick typically unless it’s bad, and it’s rarely bad. I know that I’m going to pay when I go because I have such a big deductible. The last time we were at a doctor because one of us was actually sick would have been a year ago at New Year’s. My younger daughter ended up with a sinus infection, and because it was an infection, we needed antibiotics. We went to a nurse practitioner, so we chose not to go to a doctor but to somebody who could handle it just as well, so we saved money there. We just consume healthcare differently because we’re aware of the cost, and we make ourselves aware of the cost. That is part of understanding what is covered and what is not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Should the law be completely overturned or should the government find way to improve it?&lt;/strong&gt; I think the talk about overturning it is a lot of hogwash. They’re not going to overturn it. What they’re going to do is repeal it and replace it with a lot of the same things because if they didn’t, they would have a revolution on their hands. They’re going to replace it with a lot of the same things and call it something else. Probably what they’ll do is push people toward plans like what I have. We as Americans consume way too many health services. We have a system that should, by all rights, be the least expensive, but it’s not. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I don’t believe it should be overturned. I don’t see any point in that. If cooler heads prevailed, I think even Republicans would find it politically expedient to say, “Here are the things that work. We admit, this works.” It was Mitt Romney’s plan to begin with, by the way. We’re talking about a plan that made sense because of the individual mandate. It’s a responsibility issue, and that’s a very Republican kind of issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think simply the law should be amended and fixed. Honestly, in the end, it’s hard to see why you wouldn’t have a system like most of the richest countries in the world, like Canada’s and Britain’s, which is a healthcare system that’s basically paid for by the government and open to everybody. Single payer is going to end up being where we focus on outcomes, and not on payments and deductibles. You focus on health outcomes; the system gets cheaper. That was happening under the ACA, as well. They were paying doctors for having good health outcomes, instead of paying doctors for prescribing tests. I have a hard time thinking that the system can change a lot. If they go back to the way things were before, I may survive, but you’re going to see a lot of people lose their homes and businesses even though they have health insurance. Most of the people who were losing everything, who were going bankrupt because of health issues, already had insurance when they got sick. That’s just wrong. We’re a caring, rich society, and there’s just something really fundamentally, philosophically, ethically, morally wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Are you better or worse off than you were before the ACA became law? &lt;/strong&gt;We’re definitely better off, no doubt, and that’s because of the preventative care that comes with our insurance now and because of those lifetimes maximums — and the fact our daughter, who is in college now, can stay on the healthcare until she’s 26. She’s likely, in this economy, to need more than a bachelor’s degree, so she will probably go on to get at least a master’s. She will likely be in school for a long time and not earning, and being able to keep her on my insurance for that long is going to give her a good start as well. So there are a lot of benefits to us and to society, so we’re better off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Should the U.S. government be responsible for providing healthcare to its citizens? Is healthcare insurance a basic human right? &lt;/strong&gt;This is something I think a lot about. Where does clean air come from? It certainly doesn’t come from corporations who just decide out of the goodness of their hearts to make sure that the crap they pump into the air is clean.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We need the government to regulate the industry so that we have clean air and clean water. For some reason, people can’t seem to act honorably or with integrity 100 percent of the time. We rely on the government to make sure we have clean air and clean water. We believe that’s a basic human right. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We’ve already kind of established that. But then you go into food and housing, and things get murkier. People think if you get something for free, and you don’t work for it, then you’re just a freeloader.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthcare is there as well. We all need food. We all need water. We all need healthcare. We all need housing to live. To a certain extent, yes, the government has to be there to help provide for people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the issues with healthcare is that we all are dealt vastly different cards when we’re born, on the healthcare front. I do not know whether I will come up with cancer or need a liver transplant when I’m born. I cannot control that, except trying to eat healthy and work out. If that much of it is luck, are we really saying as a society, “Oh man, you were just unlucky so you get to lose everything?” Are we really that kind of society? Yes, I do believe ethically. For some people, it’s moral in terms of their religions, but for me, it’s an ethical issue. I do believe we are some of the most wealthy people in the world, even the poorest of us, and we have an obligation to people who are less well-off to provide some of those things. So yes, we as a society, whether you say it’s the government, we have the obligation to make sure we have good healthcare for everybody.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It just makes economic sense. I heard this a lot when I was getting out of college, “I need to take a job. I need health insurance.” When I look back on it, there’s a lot of creative innovation that doesn’t happen because people are horrified of losing everything if they get sick. Can you imagine if we just took care of that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
The death of a California man who was being treated for cancer is being blamed on a rare fungal infection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/contaminated-medical-marijuana-pot-believed-to-have-killed-cancer-patient/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CBS report&lt;/a&gt;, the man may have been exposed to the fungus while using contaminated medical marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following his death, researchers tested 20 medical marijuana samples from dispensaries around Northern California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A study from the University of California, Davis, found that most were contaminated with unsafe bacteria and fungi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of them can cause serious lung infections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fungi included cryptococcus, mucor, and aspergillus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bacteria included &lt;em&gt;E. coli, Klebsiella pneumonia,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The findings are published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(16)30605-X/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clinical Microbiology and Infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Researchers caution people with cancer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.C. Davis researchers warn that smoking, vaping, or inhaling aerosolized marijuana could be dangerous to some people with serious ailments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with leukemia, lymphoma, AIDS, or others undergoing immune suppressing therapies are at particular risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also advise against using marijuana in baked goods. At least for now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They theorize that cooking would destroy the bacteria and fungi, but they have not seen experimental evidence of this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Patients with impaired immune systems are routinely advised to avoid exposure to plants and certain raw foods because of the risk of infection from soil-dwelling organisms,” Dr. George Thompson III, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/11791&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thompson is an associate professor of clinical medicine at U.C. Davis in the Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology. He was also a lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But at the same time, they are increasingly turning to medical marijuana to help them with symptom control,” he continued. “Because microorganisms known to cause serious infections in immunocompromised patients were found to be common on marijuana, we strongly advise patients to avoid it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the study’s authors, marijuana from legal dispensaries isn’t necessarily safe. That’s because there’s no federal regulation for quality. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, doctors may not link an infection to medical marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How marijuana helps people with cancer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Medical marijuana seems to be potentially helpful for many cancer problems,” said medical oncologist Dr. Jack F. Jacoub. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with Healthline, Jacoub said medical marijuana can help with numbness and tingling (neuropathy), nausea, and loss of appetite. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It can also help with chronic pain syndromes related to the disease or treatment,” continued Jacoub, who is director of thoracic oncology at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.memorialcare.org/find-doctors/physician/jack-f-jacoub-md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MemorialCare Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in Southern California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jacoub said these are tough symptoms to control. And he’s seen better-than-expected results. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Other prescription medications have a role. Without a doubt. But you have to work with the side effects. Some patients really respond to medical marijuana,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medical marijuana can be delivered in many ways, including smoking, inhaling, eating, and even in oil. Marijuana also has some side effects, including the “high.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m quite convinced we’re only beginning to understand its use in cancer patients,” said Jacoub. “Some people come back after trying many things and medical marijuana is the one thing that helped. There’s definitely a group of people that benefit. You’d have to be shortsighted not to see that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What cancer patients need to know&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not all cancers are alike.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jacoub explained that in general, cancer develops due to a preexisting degree of immune system incompetence. Some cancers are tightly associated with a compromised immune system. These include leukemias and lymphomas. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, some chemotherapy drugs will further suppress the immune system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Patients are notified of this. Infection can be severe and life-threatening. They’re told what to avoid and what to report to their physician,” said Jacoub.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re advised not to eat fresh fruits and vegetables without cooking or steaming. Some can’t even have fresh plants in their rooms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These people should be very careful. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Please discuss this with a physician experienced in dealing with compromised immune systems,” Jacoub suggested. “They will understand the nuances and can advise you. Don’t take it upon yourself.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have cancer and want to try medical marijuana, Jacoub has a few other suggestions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, decide what symptoms you need help with that you’re not getting help with now. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, visit a dispensary that has an abundance of experience dealing with your condition. Ask about the potential side effects of various products. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The route probably most concerning for infection like the one reported is smoking,” said Jacoub. “Warning signs of infection are a nagging cough and phlegm. Some people have chest pain. But the biggest one is fever.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regulations vary from state to state and aren’t always clear. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There should be tighter regulations. Without them, it’s still a risk, even when you buy from a dispensary. But it’s probably safer than buying on the street. Hopefully, that part of the market will ultimately disappear,” said Jacoub.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s limited data on medical marijuana use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t have large clinical trials. But there have been some really interesting outcomes in patients who report improvements in symptoms,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Making informed decisions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cannabis is an agricultural product and it is unreasonable to expect that it would be free of bacteria and fungus that are found routinely in soil,” said cannabis therapeutics expert Dr. Jordan Tishler of &lt;a href=&quot;https://inhalemd.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Inhale MD&lt;/a&gt; in Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an email to Healthline, Tishler explained that it’s not well understood if any of those pathogens routinely survive smoking, vaporizing, or cooking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Best evidence to date suggests that temperatures around 350 degrees Fahrenheit and higher will kill these agents. What isn’t clear is whether smoking and vaporizing achieve these temperatures in a thorough enough manner to kill whatever’s in there. What we need, and do not yet have, is testing of the smoke/vapor output to viable organisms,” said Tishler.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tishler makes the point that marijuana use by people with cancer is not new. It’s been going on for decades, if not longer. Even so, it’s rare that an illness is traced back to medical marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It could be countered that we haven’t been looking for such. But if it were enough of a hazard, I would suspect we would have noticed,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tishler said there’s no doubt we need more research. But he believes there’s adequate data to make informed decisions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The key is to have a detailed and thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of cannabis therapy with a caring, educated cannabis specialist in conjunction with the rest of your medical team,” he advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Mediterranean Diet Good for Cholesterol Functions</title>

None of the diets increased HDL levels significantly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the Mediterranean diet rich in virgin olive oil improved key HDL functions, including helping the body remove excess cholesterol from arteries, serving as an antioxidant, and keeping blood vessels open — all of which reduce cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results among the three groups were relatively similar because the modifications of the Mediterranean diet were modest and the control diet was a healthy one, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/135/7/633&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was published in the American Heart Association journal Circulation&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

en Terry Fulmer’s 90-year-old aunt fell and tore her shoulder ligaments, she had surgery in Albany, a two-hour drive from her home in rural upstate New York.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Maybe she could have gotten care in a closer town. But her daughter lives in Albany so she had to go there because that’s where she recovered. She couldn’t feed herself, she couldn’t dress herself,” said Fulmer, Ph.D., R.N., F.A.A.N., president of the John A. Hartford Foundation in New York, a foundation dedicated to improving the care of older adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For people living in a city, or even in a suburb, the nearest hospital is often a short drive — or bus or subway ride — away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not true for people living in rural America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As part of a study on barriers older adults face to entering nursing homes, Carrie Henning-Smith, Ph.D., M.P.H., M.S.W., a research associate at the University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center, hears stories of people who are discharged from the hospital ending up in a nursing home four or five hours from their home — or worse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We talked with a discharge planner who placed someone 10 or 11 hours away from their home, which is a bit of an outlier case. But those things happen in rural communities in ways that they don’t in urban communities,” Henning-Smith, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, the situation has become even more dire, particularly for rural hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/rural-hospital-closures/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;North Carolina Rural Research Program&lt;/a&gt;, 80 rural hospitals have closed since 2010.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On top of that, 673 vulnerable rural hospitals are teetering on the edge, according to a 2016 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ivantageindex.com/ccrh/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the Chartis Center for Rural Health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Obamacare’s lifeline to rural hospitals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rural America tends to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0112-rural-death-risk.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sicker&lt;/a&gt;, older, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-poverty-well-being/geography-of-poverty.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;poorer&lt;/a&gt; than the rest of the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This group suffers many health disparities. That includes higher rates of diabetes, higher rates of child mortality, fewer years of life, and loss of years of productive life,” Michael Topchik, the national leader for the Chartis Center for Rural Health, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Health insurance coverage is an important tool for helping people stay well and manage their chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expansion of the Medicaid program under the Affordable Care Act &lt;a href=&quot;http://kff.org/medicaid/fact-sheet/medicaid-pocket-primer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;provided coverage&lt;/a&gt; to millions of previously uninsured people from low-income households, including those in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The law also enabled people with lower incomes — but above the poverty line — to buy coverage through the states’ &lt;a href=&quot;http://kff.org/uninsured/fact-sheet/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;health insurance marketplaces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before the expansion, hospitals still treated uninsured patients. But they were never paid for the medical care provided.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This “charity care” eats away at a hospital’s bottom line, as do other bills that aren’t paid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By increasing the number of people with health insurance, the Medicaid expansion directly benefitted rural hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In states that expanded Medicaid, “we saw two important trends — reduction in uncompensated charity care and a reduction in the number, or the velocity, of the rural hospital closures,” Dr. Daniel Derksen, director of the Arizona Center for Rural Health, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nineteen states, though, opted not to expand Medicaid. In those states, the suffering among &lt;a href=&quot;http://khn.org/news/lack-of-medicaid-expansion-hurts-rural-hospitals-more-than-urban-facilities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rural hospitals&lt;/a&gt; is palpable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Chartis report found that Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, and Texas all have particularly high rates of vulnerable rural hospitals. At the time the report was released, none of those states had &lt;a href=&quot;http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/?currentTimeframe=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;expanded Medicaid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rural safety net unraveling&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In spite of the boost given by Medicaid expansion, the healthcare outlook for rural areas is still grim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We see that the safety net is fiscally strained,” said Topchik, “and we worry that the erosion of the operating margin will impact the mission.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rural healthcare safety net is a collection of programs and policies with a mission to ensure that the almost &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ua/urban-rural-2010.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;60 million people&lt;/a&gt; living in geographically isolated regions of the United States have access to quality healthcare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medicaid is a big part of the net, as are Medicare and the State Children’s Health Insurance programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a pretty noble mission,” said Topchik. “But there’s an old expression in business, which is ‘no margin, no mission.’” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In recent years, some state and federal policies have been chipping away at the operating margin of many rural hospitals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s often referred to by advocates as ‘death by a thousand cuts,’” said Topchik. “If you have a safety net and you start snipping individual webs in the net, eventually it unravels.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Chartis report, in states that expanded Medicaid, 36 percent of rural hospitals had a negative operating margin in 2015 — meaning they are losing money. In states that didn’t expand Medicaid, 47 percent of rural hospitals had a negative operating margin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For hospitals with the worst operating margin — lower than negative 5 percent — about 18 percent of rural hospitals in Medicaid-expansion states fell into this category, while 30 percent in non-Medicaid-expansion states did.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Repeal, replace may hurt rural health&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hospitals with a negative operating margin have a harder time absorbing cuts to government funding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like the reductions that may come with the Republican-controlled Congress’ plan to “repeal and replace” Obamacare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because no alternative plan is in place yet, its effect on Medicaid and the state health exchanges is unknown, leaving already vulnerable rural hospitals hanging in the wind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could have an even wider effect on rural communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hospitals are often important parts of rural communities, sometimes serving as the community's largest employer,” said Henning-Smith. “Closing a rural hospital means all of the people who were employed there lose their jobs — or be transferred out of town.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When hospitals leave, physician practices, pharmacies, and other medical services may follow. So may nonmedical businesses frequented by hospital employees, like restaurants and shops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Chartis report, if all 673 vulnerable rural hospitals closed, it would mean a loss of 99,000 healthcare jobs and 137,000 community jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can add to the stress experienced by people in rural areas, especially for the aging population that lives there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You can imagine how terrifying it is in these communities if they believe that one of their hospitals is going to close,” Fulmer told Healthline. “Not only do they lose the personal relationship with the care providers, but also how will they get to where they need to go for healthcare?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/021517_honorscientists_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jinelle Wint researches better therapies for Parkinson’s disease with the help of zebra fish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alison Young studies the rocky intertidal coastal zone with the help of “citizen science” volunteers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;David Steen studies how animals use landscapes so he can better understand how humans can share those areas with other species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing unites all these researchers. They’re still alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week they, along with thousands of other scientists, took a moment away from their research to remind the Twittersphere that the United States is full of living, working, tweeting scientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hashtag &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23actuallivingscientist&amp;amp;src=typd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;#ActualLivingScientist&lt;/a&gt; swept through labs across the country in an effort to raise awareness of the value of scientific research, even as a science-skeptic administration takes over the White House as well as the agencies many scientists rely on for funding and data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steen, who has more than 16,000 followers and was once called the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/wild_things/2015/05/29/snake_science_on_twitter_david_steen_identifies_photos_as_copperheads_and.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;best biologist on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;,” was spurred to create the hashtag on Feb. 5 after another Twitter user said they wouldn’t prioritize funding for his field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He attributed the action to the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://newvoicesforresearch.blogspot.com/2009/07/can-you-name-living-scientist.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;83 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Americans cannot name a living scientist. He tweeted the stat and one of his followers suggested the hashtag.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It took off after that,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hashtag was still being used in dozens of tweets a day two weeks after it started — and reaching beyond scientists’ existing Twitter followers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wint, for instance, who has been on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DrWint_signalin/status/827710909044891648&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; less than a year and has less than 500 followers, got 870 retweets and 3,176 likes for her post. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I could not have imagined how popular the hashtag would become, being used by thousands of people and viewed by millions,” Steen, Ph.D., a wildlife ecologist, and assistant research professor at Auburn University, said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why it matters right now&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Science has been under fire for years by &lt;a href=&quot;http://billmoyers.com/2015/02/03/congress-climate-deniers/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Republicans in Congress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, with the election of a president who has said that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/03/hillary-clinton/yes-donald-trump-did-call-climate-change-chinese-h/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;climate change is a hoax&lt;/a&gt;, that fire is now also coming from the White House.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those supporting the new campaign to honor researchers say if there were more “actual, living” scientists in the public eye, sharing their research in accessible ways and demonstrating the value of what they do, it would be a lot easier for skeptical nonscientists to trust the data on something like climate change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Many people probably don't know a scientist in their everyday lives — as a neighbor, or as someone in their community — though I'm sure they're there. And many people probably also feel disconnected from science in their everyday lives — even though science touches almost all aspects of life today,” said &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alisonkestrel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Young&lt;/a&gt;, who helps lead citizen science programs at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It disheartens me to see people distrusting science and ‘science conspiracy’ being normalized. It pushes people further away from the fact that science is part of their lives,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steen noted that many scientists have been active in outreach for years, but “lately it does seem that there have been more calls for scientists to get involved in science communication and outreach.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In December, scientists at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting in San Francisco gathered at a lunchtime rally with signs and megaphones saying they would “stand up for science.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A nationwide “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marchforscience.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;march for science&lt;/a&gt;” is planned for Earth Day in April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists, normally reluctant to be seen as activist or political, are beginning to see no other choice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hashtag and efforts like it are ways to actively reach out to the public, rather than simply making yourself available, says Steen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As #ActualLivingScientist highlighted, it is asking too much of the general public to expect them to find you. Sometimes you've got to conduct true outreach and find them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where it goes from here&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another thing the hashtag highlighted is how many scientists are not only on Twitter, but active on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wint, for instance, set up her account last April after taking a couple classes on science communication at Stony Brook University, where she’s a Ph.D. student.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said the classes underscored how Twitter can be used as a way to collaborate and communicate with both scientists and the general public outside the bubbles of her field and school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just as a fake news link can reach millions of people on Twitter, so can a real scientific fact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Young says she saw the power of that direct outreach earlier this week when singer-songwriter Neko Case retweeted to her 126,000 followers a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/alisonkestrel/status/829894902418796544&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;photo of an anemone&lt;/a&gt; Young had posted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was blown away,” says Young.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the case of #ActualLivingScientist, the hashtag coincided with the popularity of another hashtag, #DressLikeAWoman, stemming from a report that President Trump prefers his female employees to “dress like a woman.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That gave the campaign an extra twist as female scientists tweeted photos of themselves in lab coats and muddy jeans with the dual hashtags in an effort to share that not only are scientists all around, they may look different than you’re picturing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The stereotypical scientist is a white guy in a lab coat, and it's been great to see everyone shatter that stereotype,” Steen says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Was anyone outside the scientists’ bubbles listening?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A nonscientific &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rhskraus/status/829242233689882629&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Twitter poll&lt;/a&gt; asking who is following the hashtag #ActualLivingScientist found that a third of the followers identified themselves as nonscientists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epipen.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EpiPen&lt;/a&gt; was listed at $608.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, the couple opted for a generic epinephrine auto-injector that their health insurance plan would cover at no cost to them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, when D’Angelo went to register his son for kindergarten in a New York public school, he was told the generic version wasn’t acceptable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teachers had not been trained on those devices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, D’Angelo shelled out about $500 for a packet of two EpiPens, one for the school nurse and the other for his son’s classroom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not cheap, but the peace of mind it affords is worth it,” D’Angelo told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;D’Angelo said the price is a bit of a burden, but his family can absorb the cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other parents of children with severe allergies aren’t as fortunate, especially with the Auvi-Q device &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/13/kaleo-epipen-maker-alternative-drug-pharmaceutical&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;returning to the market&lt;/a&gt; this week with a listed price of $4,500.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I can’t see it being easy on anyone,” said D’Angelo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nobody pays full price&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The listed price for the epinephrine auto-injectors can be misleading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tonya Winders, president and chief executive officer of the Allergy &amp;amp; Asthma Network, said it’s similar to the sticker price on a new car.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more of a starting point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winders said companies like Mylan, which manufactures the EpiPen, and Kaleo, which produces Auvi-Q, negotiate exclusive deals with insurance companies and pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The overall price is usually lowered through rebates and discounts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A patient will pay a certain amount at their pharmacy and their insurance will pay an undisclosed amount to the manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winders said it’s been reported that Mylan gets $274 for each EpiPen packet while the remaining $334 goes to the pharmacy and other entities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Winders added, a consumer might never know how much their insurance company actually paid because the exclusive deals keep those figures secret.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s not a lot of transparency,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at Kaleo said in an email to Healthline that the company has an “access program” that allows most consumers with insurance to pay nothing for their Auvi-Q product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if a consumer’s insurance plan doesn’t pay for the device, Kaleo officials said the company absorbs the cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Company officials added that households without government or commercial insurance that earn less than $100,000 a year also pay nothing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People without insurance pay a cash price of $360.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Kaleo believes that the most important price is the price to the patient,” Mark Herzog, vice president of corporate affairs, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The burden on families&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;D’Angelo notes that whatever a family pays for an auto-injector, it is an ongoing cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The devices usually expire about a year after they are purchased, so they need to be replaced annually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, parents need to buy two packets. One for their child’s school and one for their home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says there is also paperwork to fill out and hoops to jump through to make sure their child is safe at school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not made easy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winders said the annual costs can be a financial burden for some families, especially since the devices are considered to be an essential commodity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a severe allergy attack, you don’t have time to drive to the pharmacy or the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These are not luxury items,” Winders said. “They are lifesaving devices.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winders and D’Angelo said it’s difficult to know if a family’s insurance costs will rise if they are purchasing epinephrine auto-injectors on an annual basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It goes up every year anyway,” said D’Angelo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Winders said having the auto-injectors is like having life insurance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You hope you never have to use them, but they are there if you need them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Misconceptions about vaccines can also cause people — especially parents — to question or avoid them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Brady, the associate medical director at Nationwide Children’s Hospital, and member of the hospital’s Division of Infectious Diseases, told Healthline that many parents &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/02/06/parents-of-young-children-are-more-vaccine-hesitant/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;avoid&lt;/a&gt; having their children vaccinated because they hear inaccurate reports about side effects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The common theme is that ‘someone’ has told them about their child or even a friend or relative’s child that had a terrible response after getting a vaccine. Then if they go to the internet, there is so much inaccurate information, that it compounds the problem,” Brady explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flu season significant&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One vaccine parents may have their families skip is the flu shot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In past years, reports have emerged that the shots weren’t effective, or even caused the flu. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most of the time, the illness that they got was not influenza but rather a different, but less serious, respiratory or gastrointestinal virus,” Brady noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although some people get the flu after getting the vaccine, it reduces overall numbers and makes the virus less severe, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We are in the midst of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/07/flu-prevention-children/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;significant flu season&lt;/a&gt; where pediatric hospitalizations and deaths are mounting. In New York, &lt;a href=&quot;http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2017/02/07/flu-prevention-children/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CBS&lt;/a&gt; reported there were four child deaths from the flu this year — the same number as reported in &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/child-flu-deaths-in-ohio-on-the-rise&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From Jan. 29 to Feb. 4 of this year, the CDC reports that five children died from the flu. As of earlier this week, 20 children had died nationally according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm#S3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brady believes that pediatricians do a good job of promoting vaccines, but adult providers are “not quite as used to incorporating vaccine recommendations into their general adult well-patient visits” though they are getting better. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/021417_gmofood_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are back in the news.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s because some genetically modified produce is heading for store shelves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GMO apples and potatoes will be in Midwest produce departments this month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s the start of a 2017 rollout of these types of items. And should provide some food for grocery aisle debate. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GMOs are created in a laboratory when genes from the DNA of one species are extracted and artificially forced into the genes of an unrelated plant or animal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects, animals, or even humans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;To eat or not to eat?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you don’t want to eat GMO food, said Alexis Baden-Mayer, political director of the Organic Consumers Association, you have one clear option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Organic is one’s only defense,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Food that is certified non-GMO is actually another option for concerned shoppers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Until recently no fresh produce were GMOs. It was mainly soybeans and corn, which was not available as fresh products,” Jaydee Hanson, senior policy analyst of the Center for Food Safety, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The vast majority of corn, soy, canola, and sugar beets grown in the United States is now genetically engineered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These items are often used as ingredients in processed foods. Tests have shown that GMOs are present in many packaged foods, such as breakfast cereals, chips, baking mixes, and protein bars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Does that present a health danger?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The contention that GMOs pose no risks to human health can’t be supported by studies that have measured a time frame that is too short to determine the effects of exposure over a lifetime,” said Dr. Robert Gould, president of the board of Physicians for Social Responsibility, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/02/gmo-foods-what-you-need-to-know/index.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 interview&lt;/a&gt; with Consumer Reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Coming to a store near you&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now GMO apples and potatoes will be in grocery store produce bins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A GMO apple looks like any other except for one salient feature. It won’t turn brown. The company has turned off some of the genes that make them change color.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s the catch, according to Hanson, “The apples are sitting in the store looking white [inside], but may be covered with microbes not covered by genetic engineering.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He cited food industry arguments that a lot of fruit goes to waste because it turns brown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Maybe that’s a good thing because of those other microbes,” Hanson said. “Does it still taste fresh? I don’t know. It’s not that difficult to cut up an apple.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Potatoes are on their way as well, probably in the form of chips or other processed food, Hanson noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, apples were preserved by being sprayed with something acidic, such as lemon juice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanson doesn’t know what is done to the Arctic Apples, the name of the supplier. It’s a division of Intrexon, which describes itself as designing biologically-based consumer solutions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Look for the label&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Labeling of GMO food remains a hot-button issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, the food industry doesn’t like labels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Vermont passed a labeling law last year, the industry responded by backing what they considered to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/aug/2/obama-signs-bill-overturning-vermonts-gmo-labeling/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;weaker national law&lt;/a&gt;. Hanson noted that law precluded states such as Vermont from legislating on their own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, that action has led to an unexpected consequence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new labeling law will require regulations to determine how these rules will work, who will provide oversight, and so on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the Trump administration has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/30/trump-orders-two--one-repeal-all-new-regulations/97237870/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that for every new regulation produced, two old ones must be tossed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where that leaves them, nobody knows, Hanson said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dealing with the climate in Washington presents a real challenge now, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Nothing will change immediately. We may have a new law on the kind of labeling, or it may be put on hold,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It may be labeling lite,” he added, half joking. “I’d prefer to see something straightforward, like you have on a Snickers bar. But we’re not going to get that from most food companies.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanson said good labeling might be something small printed on the package that a consumer could scan with a phone, “while they’re shepherding three kids through the supermarket.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baden-Mayer takes it a step further, noting that the administration will be limited on what regulations it wants on GMO crops.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think these extreme tactics would probably hurt farmers who would benefit from FDA rules,” she said. “The whole process may become unbearable … maybe grind to a halt.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Going organic&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baden-Mayer acknowledges that eating organic takes more work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Don’t buy prepared food. Live near an organic market,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing that drives consumers to an organic approach is children with health problems, including behavioral issues, digestive problems, being on the autism spectrum, allergies, and even cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When children have health problems, the parents are interested in what can be done to help them,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That may mean eliminating a food or two or restricting the diet and then adding foods as health improves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Lots of parents find organic foods reduce the intensity of their child’s symptoms,” Baden-Mayer said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added that it helps to have a holistic physician, someone interested in diet issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unresolved issues&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, the GMO issue remains in flux.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not known whether new products will be introduced with new regulations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s also not known whether these products will have consumer-friendly labeling or whether they’ll be considered a health risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider Polly’s plight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cartoon from 2014 by Ann Tenae shows a parrot on a perch saying, “Polly wants a gluten-free, low sodium, non-GMO cracker.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good luck with that, Polly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Ingestible Capsule Powers Itself Using Gastric Acid

<description>
<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/tech/021417_stomachacid_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Boston have come up with a novel new way of powering ingestible capsules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team at Brigham and Women’s Hospital has developed a capsule that can be powered by a galvanic cell battery that draws its juice from stomach acid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team demonstrated this by having their battery successfully power an ingestible thermometer. It took measurements every 12 seconds inside a pig’s stomach for six days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts in the field say that while there’s still a lot of work to be done, the research could be an important step to improving the long-term utility of ingestible devices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team was led by Phillip Nadeau, Ph.D., study author, and postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They announced their findings in Prolonged Energy Harvesting for Ingestible Devices, published in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-016-0022&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nature Research&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Useful ... until the battery dies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ingestible devices are useful tools for doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are utilized in a variety of applications from simple vital sign measurement, to dispensing medication, to “pill cams,” which provide video feedback as an alternative to more invasive means of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These devices, particularly the more energy-intensive pill cams, are limited by a lack of power. While simpler devices use minimal power, a pill cam tends to drain its battery quickly, with no means of recharging while it’s inside the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an effort to develop a device that could provide continuous power on a long-term basis, the research team turned to an old science class standby.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of the things we started contemplating with our collaborators in the Department of Electrical Engineering at MIT was looking at a galvanic cell, basically a takeoff of the lemon battery that’s often explored in school,” Giovanni Traverso, Ph.D., senior co-author, and instructor at Harvard Medical School, told Healthline. “And that’s exactly what we did. We used the gastric fluid as the electrolyte, and we used the copper and zinc as the cathode and anode, respectively, to generate that current.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the researchers put forth some interesting demonstrations of a zinc-copper type electrolytic cell for power,” John Rogers, Ph.D., physical chemist, and chair of the Rogers Research Group at the University of Illinois, told Healthline. “By comparison to more widely used magnesium-based systems, the appeal of zinc is that it can offer long-term operation — several days, as opposed to one or two. So I think that’s an important advance. There’s an electrical engineering team involved in that work that put together some pretty interesting low-power electronics. They had some pretty clever ways to optimize the power utilization and accommodate for the fluctuations in the power that were coming from the battery.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drew Higgins, Ph.D., Banting Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University, told Healthline in an email, “The authors took fundamental electrochemistry concepts that many of us would have applied through lemon battery or penny battery experiments in school. While this battery chemistry may not be practical for your cell phone or laptop, the authors recognized some key features of these systems. Primarily, they are inexpensive, biocompatible, and capable of producing enough energy to power microdevices assembled in their laboratory.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A variety of skills&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technology, which couples electrochemistry with biomedical engineering, required researchers with varied skillsets. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We did have a diverse group with expertise ranging from electronics design to packaging, chemistry, and medicine,” wrote Nadeau. “Having such a diverse team was a tremendous asset to this work. Working at the interface of these different areas helped us find and try something that was broadly interesting.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are electrical engineering challenges here, there are materials challenges, and then there are animal model challenges,” acknowledged Traverso. “So you really need a broad expertise to come together, collaborate, and execute. And that’s reflected in the manuscript when you look at the authors and where they come from. They come from departments in electrical engineering, chemical engineering, from hospitals, and I think it really takes that kind of collaboration to address some of the major challenges.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Higgins says this multidisciplinary approach is crucial — not just in this research, but in other scientific endeavors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As scientists and engineers, we consistently talk about the fact that interdisciplinary collaborations underpin some of the most high impact research,” he wrote, “And this study exemplifies this perfectly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Big possibilities, big challenges&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This technology could underpin the way ingestible devices operate in the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research, however, is still in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nadeau says that miniaturizing the device and using more advanced circuit design is a priority.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’d also like to explore more advanced sensors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, it would be neat if five or 10 years down the road, we could power a long-term ingestible vital signs monitor with this technology,” Nadeau said. “Essentially, a pill that could monitor your breathing and heart rate from inside the stomach and transmit it wirelessly for up to a week using the harvested energy from the cell.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You can just let your imagination run wild with things you’d like to measure, sense, capture, store, sample, or even deliver therapy. Kind of the whole gamut,” said Rogers. “But I think the menu of options is going to be limited by the range of functionality you can pack into a relatively small footprint. But then, the overarching concern is going to be how to power it. I think going forward, there will probably be a lot of optimization you can do. But it’s a good starting point for sure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“With respect to where we could be in five or 10 years, I think that depending on further interest — and that means collaboration with potential sponsors and also further funding — I think we could be in humans fairly quickly,” said Traverso.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A New Possibility: Women with Heart Defects Having Babies
</title>
<link>

<description>
<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/womens-health/020917_heartbabies_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erica Thomas was born with several heart defects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At birth her outlook was poor, and her early years were focused on staying alive. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We had to move to low altitude away from family and friends. I didn't play competitive sports as a kid and often would require a modified version of P.E. in school and sometimes even academic assistance,” Thomas told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 37-year-old has undergone three major heart surgeries as well as a pacemaker implantation for her four heart defects — a trial septal defect (ASD), single ventricle defect, pulmonary atresia, and tricuspid atresia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She is one of 2.5 million people in the United States living with congenital heart defects. About 1.4 million are adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 2000, the number of people with heart defects who are living into adulthood has increased by 63 percent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pressure on the heart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A growing number of women with congenital heart defects are now hoping to become pregnant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under &lt;a href=&quot;http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2017/01/12/CIR.0000000000000458&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from the American Heart Association (AHA) this may now be possible for some of them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traditionally, doctors have advised women with complex congenital heart conditions not to get pregnant, due to the pressure both pregnancy and childbirth place on the heart. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/successful-pregnancy-possible-for-some-women-with-high-risk-congenital-heart-disease-2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AHA&lt;/a&gt;, “changes from pregnancy tax the heart and circulatory system. Blood volume increases by about 40 percent, cardiac output increases 30 percent to 50 percent, and heart rate rises 10 to 20 beats per minute.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such changes dramatically impact the cardiovascular system, and in women with congenital heart defects this poses a particular risk. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A major concern is whether the heart muscle is strong enough to sustain the physiological changes of normal pregnancy,” Mary Canobbio, R.N., chair of the statement-writing group for the new guidelines, and lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), School of Nursing, told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If the muscle is already weak by the cardiac condition, the extra burden can cause further weakening,” she added. “Other changes, primarily hormonal can lead to irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias) ... especially in those women who have had arrhythmias before conception. Some of these are quite serious and can be fatal.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Canobbio notes another concern is the changes in pregnancy that can increase the risk of developing clots. Some heart conditions are prone to clot formation before conception, and pregnancy may increase the risk of thrombosis (a clot), embolism (a clot that travels), and stroke. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pregnancy a possibility&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new set of recommendations from the AHA is providing the medical community with the guidance to help women with congenital heart defects have successful pregnancies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This really represents a shift in thinking and offers new hope for a growing segment of our society,” said Canobbio in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://ucla.multimedia-newsroom.com/index.php/2017/02/06/growing-group-of-women-take-heart-in-pregnancy-recommendations/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the recommendations, the AHA suggests women undertake extensive preconception testing and counseling, to determine if they can safely deliver a baby. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the woman is deemed able to safely have a baby she should then work alongside a team of specialists including an OB-GYN trained in high-risk pregnancies, as well as a cardiologist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The good news is that for the majority of women with congenital heart disease, the risk of pregnancy is small. But for a number of defects, especially those considered complex, the risk is much higher and it is this group of women who must have not only preconceptional counseling but need to undergo full diagnostic evaluation to determine her risk before becoming pregnant,” Canobbio told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Canobbio says tools now available to manage high-risk pregnancies are instrumental in ensuring a successful pregnancy for women with congenital heart defects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, there will still be some women for whom pregnancy is deemed too high risk. In these cases, such women will be discouraged from becoming pregnant. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those that are given the “all clear” to deliver a baby, the recommendations suggest that women deliver at a large medical facility that has sufficient resources to respond to any medical emergencies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After delivery, doctors should carefully monitor the woman’s heart function for at least six weeks and in some cases up to six months. This is to check for any long-term damage that may have occurred due to the pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In both of Thomas’ pregnancies, her team of cardiologists closely monitored her. She was given regular echocardiograms, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stress-test/basics/definition/prc-20019801&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;stress tests&lt;/a&gt;, electrocardiograms, and blood pressure tests. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regular ultrasounds from her obstetrician as well as echocardiograms for the fetus were also undertaken. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A personal tale of precaution&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before both of her deliveries, Thomas was transferred via ambulance from her local medical facility to UCLA with a specialized nurse on board.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite her water breaking early in both of her pregnancies and a 74-day stay in the hospital prior to a cesarean delivery for her second baby, both Thomas and her two children are healthy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of my first questions to my cardiology team regarding family planning was, ‘Have there been other patients who have done this and what were the outcomes?’” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our decision to go forward was primarily based on my health and the recommendations of my medical team. We would not have moved forward if there were any major concerns about my well-being and my heart's ability to handle pregnancy,” she told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If there are tools and resources out there to increase our vitality and longevity, and the ability to possibly bear children, then let’s make them available to everyone everywhere,” she added. “The best way to make an informed decision is to be informed.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/womens-health/020717_girlssmart_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girls get better grades than boys in school.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also more female college graduates than males.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, why is there a much smaller number of women in science and technology fields than men?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It could be related to something that happens to girls as early as first grade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a recent study, researchers concluded that girls as young as age 6 start to think they aren’t as smart as boys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why this happens is still a mystery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What the researchers found&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Findings of the study were first reported in the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/young-girls-are-less-likely-believe-their-gender-brilliant-they-age&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the authors, the premise for the study was that men, more often than women, are associated with intellect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This assumption or stereotype is what discourages women from holding successful careers in fields that “cherish brilliance,” such as science, technology, engineering, and math (S.T.E.M.).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Because of this stereotype, are women less likely to be successful [in the workplace]?” Lin Bian, Ph.D. candidate in psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and lead author of the study, told Healthline. “It’s important to know if young girls are being held back because of these stereotypes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 400 children participated in the study, Bian said. About 75 percent of the kids were white.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To conduct the research, Bian and her team put the young students into groups and presented a few different scenarios about gender and intellect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of scenarios had the children listen to a story about a “really, really smart person,” Bian said. The researchers never disclosed if the person in the story was male or female.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the story was finished, they showed the kids pictures of two women and two men, and then asked the kids to identify who they thought the story was about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At age 5, the children usually selected their own gender. But at age 6 that changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Boys were 70 percent more likely to pick a man, but girls were only 50 percent more likely to pick a woman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bain said that response was consistent across all races.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In another setting, the researchers showed the children a game and said only “really, really smart people could play,” Bain said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They then asked the kids if they wanted to play. At age 5, both boys and girls showed equal interest. But at age 6, more girls showed less interest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why the research is important&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matthew C. Makel, Ph.D., director of research at Duke University Talent Identification Program, told Healthline that it’s rare to find researchers focusing on such young children with regard to perception of gender intelligence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He found the age of participants coupled with the line of inquiry especially insightful because the research is trying to get at the larger implications about the role of women in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the questions they are asking are great,” he said. “They should be applauded.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he also cautioned against jumping to conclusions so quickly. The particular focus group was only from one community, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We as consumers of the research need to be careful of the findings,” Makel said. “It’s still an awfully small sample.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He believes that in order for researchers to make definitive declarations about how young girls view the intelligence capacity of their gender, a bigger, more broadly based study is warranted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’d like to see the study replicated in different communities within the United States and around the world. Even better would be to follow a group of children, starting at age 5, and continue to assess their views on intelligence and gender each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“To see how individual perspectives change,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Still wondering why&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bian and her team didn't ask the kids the reasons behind their choices. That’s for another study currently under way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the researchers did discover that the children’s assumptions about their gender had nothing to do with academic ability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They asked the kids who did better in school. Both genders said girls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Makel said the children's perspectives about academics are backed up by data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Girls in general do better than boys in school. Females also consistently graduate from college at a higher rate than males. They now account for 60 percent of all college graduates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So they can succeed and excel,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But good grades and academic achievement don’t always translate into positions of power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Particularly in work settings where intelligence or brilliance is revered — even demanded — such as S.T.E.M. related careers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Females make up half of the work force in the United States, but they hold less than 25 percent of S.T.E.M. related jobs, according to a report from the Department of Commerce.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, women who hold S.T.E.M. degrees are less likely to work in these fields. Instead, they pursue careers in education or health-related industries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Makel said the answers as to why are complex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some studies have shown that women and men choose careers based on different values, Makel added. Men appear to be drawn to jobs or careers that allow them to work with things, he said. Women often lean toward careers that place a high value on building relationships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s the cause of that?” he said. “Is it biological factors or is it society?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of questions that this study is ultimately trying to get at, Makel added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bain suspects there will be multiple reasons, including influence from parents, peers, and the media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We want to find out the reasons,” she said. “The answer won’t be a single reason.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump considers himself an environmentalist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He told &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/us/politics/trump-new-york-times-interview-transcript.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt; in late November, “Clean air is vitally important. Clean water, crystal clean water, is vitally important.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then in a meeting three weeks ago with several auto industry chief executives, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/01/24/donald-trump-tells-detroit-auto-ceos-environmental-regulations-are-out-of-control/?utm_term=.787daceba397&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;he reiterated&lt;/a&gt;, “I am, to a large extent, an environmentalist.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the president’s actions speak much louder than his words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In early December, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/us/politics/scott-pruitt-epa-senate.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nominated&lt;/a&gt; former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For years, Pruitt has tried to undermine the agency’s regulations on clean water, air pollution, and other issues, even suing the EPA more than a dozen times. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pruitt has opposed EPA efforts to reduce power plant pollution. He has also tried to block such things as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule, which limits power plant emissions like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/healthy-air/sota/health-risks/?referrer=https://www.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;soot and smog pollution&lt;/a&gt;, which can cause bronchitis, cardiovascular disease, and premature death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump appears to share Pruitt’s opinion of the EPA and environmental regulations in general. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The president has vowed to cut the EPA budget by as much as $1 billion, which, officials tell Healthline, will likely lead to a national public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The EPA, courtesy of Richard Nixon&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The EPA, which was established by former President Richard Nixon in 1970, has been largely responsible for reducing human exposure to toxins and making America’s air and water cleaner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The national demand for a governmental body to address pollution was prompted by two events in 1969.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-barbara-oil-spill-1969-20150520-htmlstory.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;oil rig blowout&lt;/a&gt; that spilled 100,000 barrels of oil off the coast of Santa Barbara, Calif.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/63#.WJ4M1xIrJo4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raging fire&lt;/a&gt; on Cleveland’s Cuyahoga River, which was filled with toxic, untreated industrial waste.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both environmental disasters led to the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.earthday.org/about/the-history-of-earth-day/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Earth Day&lt;/a&gt; in 1970, when 20 million demonstrators nationwide pushed the nation in a new, more environment-friendly direction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The EPA was established that same year, as was an updated version of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clean Air Act&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Clean Water Act&lt;/a&gt; came two years later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The EPA has been at the forefront of air and water pollution control ever since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Former President Barack Obama used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.edf.org/blog/2017/01/12/ready-defend-obamas-environmental-legacy-top-10-accomplishments-focus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;agency&lt;/a&gt;, despite a generally unsupportive Congress, to protect the environment and improve public health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among other things, Obama set new pollution limits for power plant smokestacks, placed the first ever limit on carbon pollution, preserved 260 million acres by designating 19 national monuments, and, in a move just before his tenure expired, banned oil drilling in large parts of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Obama also set standards for fuel efficiency for cars and trucks, signed the largest ever commitment to protect the Gulf Coast, and signed the first major environmental law in two decades to fix the broken chemical safety landscape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/meet-4-republican-lawmakers-who-want-abolish-epa-n717061&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many Republicans&lt;/a&gt; think the EPA has too much power and is a bureaucratic waste of taxpayer money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump’s plan to cut the agency’s budget by $1 billion, along with more expected &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/1/23/14356652/trump-epa-regulations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;executive orders and new legislation&lt;/a&gt;, will reverse most, if not all, of Obama’s momentum on protections against water and air pollution, toxic waste sites, and a host of other things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the cuts, orders, and policies, which Trump says are necessary to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2017/01/24/511341779/president-trump-to-cut-regulations-by-75-percent-how-real-is-that&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;generate the country’s business machine&lt;/a&gt;, will have a devastating impact on American health, officials tell Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The environment and our health&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;David Helvarg, executive director of Blue Frontier, an ocean conservation and policy group, said that environmental issues and health are inextricably linked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It has been demonstrated over and over in this country that when we improve environmental quality, we also improve overall public health,” said Helvarg, an author whose books include “The War Against the Greens and the Golden Shore: California’s Love Affair with the Sea.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Trump’s policies will have a hazardous effect on the health of Americans,” Helvarg told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The activist noted that last year, “somewhat miraculously,” a bipartisan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2576&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;environmental bill&lt;/a&gt; made its way through both houses of Congress. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bill, which reformed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), broke a logjam in place for 20-plus years, Helvarg said, in terms of how the EPA evaluates chemicals based on the health risk they pose to the public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bill compelled the agency to get back to the job of protecting all Americans against dangerous chemicals, explained Helvarg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The EPA was not doing a great job on this,” he said. “Both sides agreed this was in the public interest. It takes an enormous amount of work to do it well, but thanks to the bill this is a new responsibility of EPA.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it seems inevitable that the new administration will revisit and possibly reverse this legislation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, one of Trump’s first acts as president was imposing a freeze on EPA grants and contracts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-administration-imposes-freeze-on-epa-grants-and-contracts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ProPublica report&lt;/a&gt;, that restriction could affect everything from water quality testing to toxic cleanups.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The new EPA director&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Trump nominated Pruitt to run the EPA, public health advocates and environmentalists were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorlines.com/articles/former-and-current-epa-employees-denounce-trumps-pick-top-administrator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he was attorney general in Oklahoma, Pruitt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/14/us/politics/document-Pruitt-v-EPA-a-Compilation-of-Oklahoma-14.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sued the EPA 14 times&lt;/a&gt;. He told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thewhim.com/trump-puts-hold-epa-grant-bars-social-media-updates/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt; two years ago that the environment would be “fine” without the EPA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pruitt also went after such things as ozone protection and air pollution standards. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pruitt sued the EPA over the requirement that technology be added on to cut mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, and a former commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, told Healthline that power plant smokestacks are the largest source of mercury emissions in the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mercury is one of most potent neurotoxins there is; as it is emitted into the atmosphere, it drifts and deposits on water bodies, and people eating big fish like tuna and swordfish are in danger of mercury ingestion,” Kimmell said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Approximately 60 percent of coal-burning power plants have adopted the technology to cut these emissions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It can be done. Technology exists, but for the 40 percent who have not, there is no reason for it,” said Kimmell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another issue that Pruitt went after when he was in Oklahoma is the complicated one of interstate air pollution. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kimmell explained that pollution goes from state A to state B, and state B doesn’t have much ability to stop this pollution. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The EPA’s purpose is to have federal regulations to police the problem of interstate air pollution,” he said. “Obama came up with a workable plan to address this problem. Pruitt sued to have it overturned. He was unsuccessful, but it is something he could choose to resurrect.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The effects in your town&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump’s EPA cuts are expected to trickle down into private, state, and municipal level entities, which receive some of their funding from the federal agency. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The important point that many people don’t realize is that a lot of the day-to-day enforcement of our environmental laws that protect our air, water, landfills, etc., are done at the state level, but funded through the federal EPA,” Kimmell said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The states agree to take on those things, he said, under the theory that they are closer to the ground and have a better understanding of what is going on in their own communities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cuts of this magnitude won’t just take away bureaucrats’ jobs in Washington,” he said. “They will mean major cuts to state enforcement of environmental laws as well.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, Kimmell said fewer rivers and streams will get tested for such things as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.water-research.net/index.php/fecal-coliform-bacteria-in-water&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fecal bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, which can cause such pathogenic diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, viral and bacterial gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In this administration, there will be far less protection of America’s rivers and streams that are used for swimming and fishing, and that puts us all at greater health risk,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This administration’s actions will also lead to dirtier air, he added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There will be less ability to enforce the laws that put caps on pollutants that come out of smoke stacks, for example,” he said. “Fewer hazardous waste sites will be cleaned up, and more toxins will get into our water supplies.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking at the bigger picture, Kimmell said, “You will see a reversal of 50 years of progress we’ve made in providing clean air and water and providing a healthy environment, even while we have grown the economy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The changes have already begun&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, House Republicans voted to dismiss a rule that prohibits the dumping of toxic coal mining debris into streams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;http://time.com/4657438/congressional-republicans-environmental-regulations-coal-streams/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Time magazine&lt;/a&gt; reported, Rep. Bill Johnson, the Ohio Republican who sponsored the dismissal, said the Obama administration rule was not designed to protect streams but was “an effort to regulate the coal mining industry right out of business.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, senior Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, strongly disagreed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He told Time that repealing the stream protection rule would “sicken and kill the very people Donald Trump falsely promised to help,” including coal miners in West Virginia and other states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rep. John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat, reportedly displayed a bottle of brownish water he said came from a constituent's well near a surface coal mine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He challenged legislators to drink from it and said the stream rule was one of the only safety measures protecting people living in coal country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Republicans in Congress later said that ending this rule was just the beginning of what will be many actions that reverse eight years of Obama’s regulations that they insist are excessive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Is regulation getting a bum rap?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kimmell said that the Trump administration is doing its best to tarnish the word “regulation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Regulation is just a synonym for protections that all of us enjoy. It’s about government setting clear rules and enforcing those rules, and not allowing a corporation to get away with putting us all at risk,” Kimmell said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He acknowledges there is a cost to having those rules in place, but says, “There is also tremendous benefit. If you don’t agree, go visit New Delhi or Beijing and try to take a jog around those cities.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump has stated repeatedly that environmental regulations are bad for business and that renewables are a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://fortune.com/2017/01/27/solar-wind-renewable-jobs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bad investment&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the findings of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://edfclimatecorps.org/sites/edfclimatecorps.org/files/the_growth_of_americas_clean_energy_and_sustainability_jobs.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;major study&lt;/a&gt; published by the Environmental Defense Fund's (EDF) Climate Corps program dispute that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It shows that the solar and wind industries are each creating jobs at a rate 12 times faster than that of the rest of the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EDF is one of the world’s largest environmental nonprofit organizations with more than 2 million members and a staff of more than 500 scientists, economists, policy experts, and other professionals around the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In its report, the organization concluded that solar and wind jobs have grown at rates of about 20 percent annually in recent years and collectively represent at least 4 million jobs in the United States, up from 3.4 million in 2011.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The renewable energy boom has been driven in part by state and local building efficiency policies and incentives and was supported by Obama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liz Delaney, program director at EDF Climate Corps, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/solar-energy-job-growth-2017-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told Business Insider&lt;/a&gt; that Trump's current approach “is basically ignoring an entire industry that has grown up over the last 10 years or so and is quite robust.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kimmell said the irony of this is that while Trump touts himself as a job creator above all else, many of his anti-environment policies will be job killers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The U.S. can afford to have a growing economy and have clean air and water,” he said. “That choice is presented to us over and over, and it is a false choice.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kimmell said Congress for a long time has been “aching” to roll back these regulations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The only thing stopping them was President Obama, who vetoed those efforts,” he said. “We now have a Congress partial to industry and a president believing that regulations are bad for the economy. That will result in a lot of serious public health consequences.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Minority health at particular risk?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The health of minorities living in America’s inner cities could be especially threatened by Trump’s cuts and orders, a number of officials told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jose Calderon, executive director of the Hispanic Federation, wrote in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/energy-environment/318637-we-must-reject-scott-pruitt-he-doesnt-car-about&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; published in The Hill last week that the “EPA’s mission of protecting our health, including promoting clean air and clean water, is particularly important for Hispanic Americans, as many of us are at heightened risk from pollution and degradation because of where we live and work.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2017, he added, 24 million Latinos lived in the country’s top 15 cities for smog pollution, and Latinos are also “overrepresented in outdoor jobs in industries like construction and agriculture, which place us on the front lines of air pollution and extreme weather.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Calderon concluded that, like all Americans, Latinos care about their health and the health of our communities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We expect the administrator of EPA to also care about us, and to align with these values.” he wrote. “Scott Pruitt, however, has built his professional career suing EPA to block or rollback measures that protect Americans from harmful pollution and its negative health effects.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Other impacts on public health&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are other decisions President Trump is likely to make that will affect America’s health, including the impending &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/obamacare-being-dismantled-now-what&quot;&gt;repeal of the Affordable Care Act&lt;/a&gt;, the defunding of &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/what-if-planned-parenthood-went-out-of-business&quot;&gt;Planned Parenthood&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/will-healthcare-for-veterans-improve-under-trump&quot;&gt;possible privatization&lt;/a&gt; of the Department of Veterans Affairs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also new fears that Trump could try “to open up additional areas &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2016/nov/22/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-says-donald-trump-intends-expand-oil-d/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;off the coast&lt;/a&gt; to oil drilling.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Californians will fight any such effort. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;California State Lands Commissioner Betty Yee &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.com/news/2017/feb/01/state-lands-commissioner-opposes-venoco-applicatio/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced last week&lt;/a&gt; she is opposing Venoco Oil’s application to expand its lease in California waters off the coast of the University of California Santa Barbara, which would be the first new or expanded lease in state waters since the 1969 spill in Santa Barbara. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Oil drilling must not be expanded,” Yee said in a statement. “The Santa Barbara Channel is a world-renowned habitat that hosts vast terrestrial and marine diversity that deserves protection from the adverse environmental impacts of further oil drilling.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fight between California’s environmental interests and Trump’s energy policy will be one to watch. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Helvarg said citizens not just in Santa Barbara but from coast to coast are preparing to resist many of this administration’s actions. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No one wants dirty air or dirty water,” Helvarg said. “Look at California, the sixth largest economy in the world. Gov. Jerry Brown has said they will stand for climate change and for the environment. There is already widespread resistance to Trump’s extreme agenda.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Officials at the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and at the White House declined requests to be interviewed for this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Would You Know What to Do If You Saw Someone Having a Severe Allergy Attack?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/020917_allergyattack_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1980, at the age of 7, I became a near expert in the most unexpected topic. Food allergies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While most of my childhood friends were out perfecting their roller-skating moves, I was home memorizing a list of allergens our family must keep away from my younger sibling in order to keep her alive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before I dive deeper into this topic, it’s important to take a slight pause.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember, this was 1980. At this time food allergies were not a “trending topic” in the media.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were no food allergy blogs. No “safe cupcakes” for school parties. No allergy alert sticky labels for kids’ lunchboxes. No storybooks for children with food allergies and their parents to read at night, reassuring them everything was going to be OK.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time, food allergies were unknown to most people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not a typical family&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Growing up I knew no other families with food allergies much less those allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, eggs, sesame, wheat, fruits, shellfish, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We were not like other families. And that was super clear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We quickly became a band of warriors on a mission to protect one of our own tribe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Birthday parties were now dairy danger zones — ice cream, cakes, and other delights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A night out at a restaurant was met with concern as we doubted our teenage waitress and if she heard our “no butter” request.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As it goes however, some crazy good often emerges when things get bad. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We learned clever solutions and life hacks in which to make our way. And years later when I went on to have children who had food allergies, I felt slightly more prepared.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two kids with combined allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, dairy, soy, sesame, shellfish, mango, and strawberries? No problem. I got this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A different era now&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Being a parent to a child with allergies in 2017, however, is far different than being one in 1980.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’ve adopted many of my mother’s smart survival techniques while adhering to new study findings and important information out these days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, we write Food Allergy &amp;amp; Anaphylaxis Emergency Care Plans, which we share with schools and others to help with positive outcomes in the event of a severe allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We share “signs to look for” with babysitters, teachers, and grandparents for an allergic reaction. These include tightness of throat, struggling to breathe, wheezing, and loss of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We share tips on ways kids describe allergic reactions that might be confusing but are crucial to listen for. These include phrases such as “my throat tickles.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, it’s still difficult in today’s modern world to keep your child with food allergies safe as they travel through their busy lives from home, school, after school, bus, playdate, soccer practice, and so on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Communication on how to keep kids with allergies safe can be lost and potentially lead to confusion in the event of a food allergy related emergency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;New guidelines released&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2017/02/09/peds.2016-4005&quot;&gt;written action plan&lt;/a&gt; to help families, schools, and communities with ways to respond to life-threatening allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The plan is featured in the AAP clinical report, Guidance on Completing a Written Allergy and Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This plan reaffirms the importance of giving epinephrine in first aid treatment for anaphylaxis-related reactions and includes written plans for when and how to use it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report is customizable and provides guidance for use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also included with the article is a second AAP clinical report called, Epinephrine for First-Aid Management of Anaphylaxis, which helps stress that administering an EpiPen is the first line of treatment for anaphylaxis episodes rather than other medications such as antihistamines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tonya Winders, the president and chief executive officer of the Allergy and Asthma Network, is excited to see the new guidance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is critically important to educate the public,” she told Healthline. “Every person can play an important role in recognizing the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and in being prepared to respond with epinephrine to save a life. The guidelines also can empower families to have a more productive dialogue with their child's pediatrician based on the best scientific evidence.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, it’s a group effort to keep our two young children safe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, I’m prepping myself for the teenage years ahead. Teens today face higher rates of anaphylaxis episodes because they are often careless with carrying their EpiPens and more casual with avoiding food allergy triggers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While other parents will be battling their teens not to text and drive I’ll do the same but while also yelling out the door, “And don’t forget your EpiPen!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kristen Duncan Williams is the Founder of FAKS: Families of Allergic Kids at School. FAKS is an organization devoted to spreading more allergy awareness in a public school setting. For more information contact: faksbrooklyn@gmail.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

t;We love our pets, and we feel like we understand them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But is that true?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How could it be, when we are two species separated by millions of years of evolution?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a Finnish &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170730&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month, people are actually about as good at interpreting the expressions on a dog’s face as they are another person’s with the most sensitive readings divined by the most empathetic people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That makes sense, says the study’s lead author, Miiamaaria Kujala, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Empathetic people have already been shown to make quicker, better assessments of facial expressions in other people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In our study, we wondered if this ability extends to perception of dogs, since dogs and humans share much of the common mammalian facial musculature, and dogs are overall quite expressive,” Kujala told Healthline in an email. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Expressive photos&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To test this theory, Kujala and her colleagues showed 30 volunteers close-up photos of dogs and humans, along with pictures of objects and blurry images.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About a third of the faces were meant to look happy, a third neutral, and a third threatening.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After rating and describing the emotional state of the subject in each picture, volunteers were given a personality test and asked to describe their experience with dogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In general, the volunteers agreed that happy faces were happy, neutral faces were unemotional or a little sad, and threatening faces were angry and aggressive — no matter whether the face was human or dog, and no matter the person’s prior experience with dogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So even without training, we may understand some of the dogs' emotional gestures if [they are] similar enough to the human respective gestures,” Kujala said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A long history together&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s probably not a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Humans and dogs go way back and we’ve influenced each other in major ways.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some studies suggest that humans bred dogs to be less aggressive and more puppylike. In fact, a recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2016/08/11/health/dogs-humans-language-faces/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that dogs in shelters that made “puppy eyes” found homes faster than other dogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dogs and humans are so tied to each other that we share some of the same genetic characteristics, as though we’ve evolved in tandem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Chicago &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/13/130514-dogs-domestication-humans-genome-science/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that dogs were domesticated as long as 32,000 years ago, and in that time the two species have developed similar genetic markers for diet, neural processing, and disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Animal-human connections&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With findings like that, perhaps it’s not surprising that scientists are increasingly trying to understand how we connect with other animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kujala is part of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/animal-mind&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research group&lt;/a&gt; in Helsinki that explores the connection between animals and people using noninvasive methods like tracking eye movements and measuring brain activity with electrodes placed on the scalp. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This study relied, in part, on a new coding system known as Dog Facial Action Coding System, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://dogfacs.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;DogFACS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The original FACS was first developed as a way to deconstruct the expressions on human faces in the 1970s, and since then spinoffs have been created for chimpanzees, monkeys, horses, and even cats. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes things get lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One expression that seems prone to misinterpretation is the smile — or at least, the tendency to pull back one’s lips and show one’s teeth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In wolves and rhesus monkeys, that look is thought to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2555422/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sign of submission&lt;/a&gt; used when greeting a superior. In chimpanzees, a beaming face might actually indicate &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chimpsanctuarynw.org/blog/2013/09/chimpanzee-smiles/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;, not happiness. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Reading the face&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The current study showed that people do indeed have some biases when they look at dogs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Volunteers rated pleasant human faces as happier than pleasant dog faces and threatening dog faces as more aggressive than threatening human faces. People also described the pleasant human faces as more intense than pleasant dog faces, as if gauging happiness is easier in people than in dogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those results “may reflect the biological and ecological importance of our own species to us, and that the potential threat from other species is commonly estimated as higher,” Kujala said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added there’s no way to know for sure that the faces in the photos didn’t actually differ in intensity in some unmeasurable way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her lab’s previous work found that people who were more experienced with dogs were more adept at reading their body language.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in this study, where only a dog’s face could be seen, experience didn’t matter as much. The ability to read a dog’s face seems to be more or less intuitive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As expected, that proved to be especially true in volunteers who scored high in emotional empathy. They were particularly quick in their assessments and rated the dog expressions as more intense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it came to cognitive empathy, though — the ability to share someone else’s perspective — there was no such link.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, we can’t quite put ourselves in a dog’s place, but we may be able to tell from its face how it feels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/tech/012017_regenerativemed_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Army scientists, working with medical technology companies, have successfully tested and used products and techniques that have enabled Army surgeons to replace the severely burned skin of soldiers as well as transplant new hands and even faces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Duke University, researchers are studying zebra fish to learn how science and medicine might someday be able to regenerate severed human spinal cords. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These examples — one already in practice and the other in the early research stages — illustrate the potential that regenerative medicine offers for the future of medical care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This research aims to go beyond easing the pain of life-threatening illnesses by changing the way diseases affect the body and then eradicating them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The vast majority of currently available treatments for chronic and/or life-threatening diseases are palliative,” Morrie Ruffin, managing director of the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM), told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ARM, based in Washington, D.C., is considered the preeminent global advocate for regenerative and advanced therapies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Other treatments delay disease progression and the onset of complications associated with the underlying illness,” he said. “Very few therapies in use today are capable of curing or significantly changing the course of disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Regenerative medicine has the unique ability to alter the fundamental mechanisms of disease, and thereby offer treatment options to patients where there is significant unmet medical need.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it has the potential to address the underlying causes of disease, Ruffin said, representing “a new and growing paradigm” in human health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The field encompasses a number of different technologies, including cell, gene, and tissue-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Helping with the wounds of war&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the Army breakthroughs, government investment was key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has invested more than $250 million in regenerative medicine research over the past decade in an effort to make promising technologies available to wounded service members.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Wendy Dean is medical officer for the Tissue Injury and Regenerative Medicine Project Management Office at the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity at Fort Detrick, Md., home to the Army’s Medical Research and Materiel Command.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Those investments have yielded a stress-shielding surgical bandage, Embrace, to reduce scarring after surgery,” Dean told Healthline. “The research has also enabled tremendous progress in burn care, allowing surgeons to improve recovery from severe burns with the use of novel skin replacement strategies, such as ReCell ‘spray-on’ skin, or skin substitutes such as StrataGraft. These skin replacement methods reduce or eliminate the need for donor sites, a frequent request of burn patients.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These revolutionary products were not developed by the Army, Dean said, but were supported with research funding, initially through the Armed Forces Institute of Regenerative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The DOD also has invested in hand and face transplantation efforts for service members and civilians whose injuries are so severe that conventional reconstruction is insufficient,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dean noted that DOD funding has supported 13 hand transplants to date, including a transplant for retired Sgt. Brendan Marrocco in 2012. He was the first service member to survive quadrilateral amputations sustained in combat. The funding also supported eight face transplants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Army’s goal is to heal those injured in battle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Regenerative medicine is still young, but it has shown tremendous progress over the last decade,” Dean said. “Our mission is to make wounded warriors whole by restoring form, function, and appearance. This field offers the best hope to someday fully restore lost tissue with tissue that is structurally, functionally, and aesthetically a perfect match. It may be years before the vision is a widespread reality, but the field is well on its way.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Helping with spinal injuries&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Duke University, Kenneth Poss, professor of cell biology, and director of the Regeneration Next initiative, was the senior investigator for a study of spinal cord regeneration in zebra fish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/11/161103142321.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; were published in November in the journal ScienceDaily. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In my lab, we are researching genetic factors that enable regeneration of tissues such as heart and spinal in nonmammalian animals like zebra fish,” Poss told Healthline. “A scientist in my lab, Mayssa Mokalled, led a study finding that a gene called connective tissue growth factor [CTGF] is important for spinal cord regeneration in zebra fish after an injury that completely severs the cord.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CTGF is necessary to stimulate cells called glia to form a tissue bridge across the severed parts of the spinal cord — an early step in spinal cord regeneration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Within eight weeks, the scientists found that zebra fish regenerate a severed spinal cord, including nerve cells, and fully reverse their paralysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developing techniques to treat and reverse spinal cord damage, a paralyzing and often fatal injury, is a pressing need in regenerative medicine, Poss said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings present a step toward understanding which glial cells can be encouraged to help heal the spinal cord, and how to stimulate this activity,” he said. “This is just the first step in many before the findings could be applied to humans.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Poss is already planning trials with mice that he hopes to start in the next few months. Mice represent an important stage in applying his latest findings, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why this field is needed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, why is regenerative medicine important?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Regenerative medicine seeks ways to re-grow or engineer healthy tissue without the need for transplants,” Poss said. “On a global scale, there’s a tremendous organ shortage, and transplantation is an expensive and nonpermanent solution. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Imagine the number of lives that could be improved if, for example, we could find ways to use the body’s innate healing mechanisms to regenerate heart muscle in patients that are spiraling toward heart failure after a heart attack.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Imagine how many lives could be improved if we could find interventions that restore functional spinal cord tissue and reverse paralysis.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ruffin of ARM sees a promising future for regenerative medicine. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We will continue to see the development of additional regenerative medicine therapies for a broad number of acute and chronic, inherited and acquired diseases and disorders,” he said. “Therapies in this area will continue to advance along the regulatory pathway, many of which are entering phase III clinical trials this year.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In fact, in the next two years, we are anticipating a number of U.S. and E.U. approvals in the cell and gene therapy sector, including therapies that address certain types of cancers, debilitating retinal disorders, rare genetic diseases, and autoimmune conditions. We also expect to see sustained investment, which will help fuel growth and product development within this sector.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A number of cell and gene therapies and technology platforms are demonstrating real potential to address areas of significant unmet medical need, Ruffin said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These include cell therapies for blood cancers and solid tumors; gene therapies for rare genetic diseases as well as chronic conditions; and gene editing for the precise targeting and modification of genetic material of a patient’s cells to cure a broad range of diseases with a single treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Poss at Duke talked about the ultimate quest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regenerative medicine has been most successful in restoring or replacing the hematopoietic tissue that creates blood, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We still lack successful regenerative therapies for most tissues,” Poss said. “The future of regenerative medicine — the holy grail — will be stimulating the regeneration of healthy tissue in patients without adding cells or manufactured tissue.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working out the details of innate mechanisms of regeneration in animals like salamanders, zebra fish, and mice, can inform this approach, he said. So can improvement in factor delivery and genome editing applications to encourage the regeneration of healthy tissue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ultimately,” Poss said, “regenerative medicine will change the toolbox of physicians and surgeons, with major impact on outcomes of diabetes, spinal cord injuries, neurodegenerative disease, and heart failure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ARM says the public does not realize how far the field has progressed in recent years. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Currently, there are more than 20 regenerative medicine products on the market,” Ruffin said, primarily in the therapeutic areas of oncology, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular repair, and wound healing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than 800 clinical trials are now underway to evaluate regenerative advanced therapies in a vast array of therapeutic categories, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing a significant focus on oncology, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative diseases, with more than 60 percent of trials falling into one of these three categories,” he added. “Even though the majority of people perceive regenerative medicine as something of the future, it’s actually here and now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/mental-health/020917_relationshipocd_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone has doubts about their relationship from time to time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But usually they’re fleeting thoughts, not prominent enough to take seriously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, for people with relationship obsessive compulsive disorder (ROCD), their doubts and fears blur reality, causing them to obsess about whether they’re happy with their partner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I was with my ex-wife for 12 years. Through that entire time, I was constantly checking to see if my love for her was as founded as I believed it was,” Aaron Harvey, founder of the OCD resource &lt;a href=&quot;http://intrusivethoughts.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Intrusivethoughts.org&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Every single time another woman was in the room, I would test my level of attraction to them compared to my attraction to my partner,” he said. “It was so distracting. I couldn’t engage in conversations. I also spent years and years evaluating one small curve or line on my wife’s face to determine whether or not I found that attractive. It became an endless cycle of doubting thoughts and I felt a slave to it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Harvey also obsessed about intellectual standards, wondering if his partner was smart enough for him or smarter than other people around them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ultimately what is happening is that you really love the person and you’re trying to prove to yourself that you actually do or that they’re enough for you. This constant obsession causes major anxiety. That in itself is the essence of OCD,” Harvey said, who struggled with various symptoms of OCD his entire life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More than vanity&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Could Harvey’s behavior be chalked up to superficiality? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not quite, says Jonathan S. Abramowitz, Ph.D., clinical psychologist, and professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People with OCD have obsessional thoughts about things that are most important to them. This means that normal everyday doubts end up escalating into clinical obsessions in the context of that need for certainty and intolerance of uncertainty,” Abramowitz told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Relationship obsessions are just one of many presentations of OCD, he notes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For some people cleanliness is important to them, so they worry about contamination and germs. For others, it may be safety, so they worry about being harmed or harming others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In terms of relationships, Abramowitz says, a person with OCD can be in a relationship and it’s clear that the relationship is going well, yet the person obsesses about knowing for sure that they’re in love with their partner, they’re doing this because the relationship is so important to them that even thinking about ending it is incredibly distressing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The senseless thoughts and doubts about the relationship don’t make sense to the person and they get upset that they’re thinking them. They might say, ‘if I love my partner, why would I have these thoughts? Maybe I don’t love them,’” Abramowitz explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with these thoughts start to resist them and begin to seek out a guarantee that they really are in love. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This makes them engage in all sorts of compulsive behaviors to try to put things right or reduce their stress. Just like other manifestations of OCD, this is what drives people to do rituals and seek reassurance that their doubts are wrong,” Abramowitz said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, if cleanliness is a concern for a person with OCD, they may wash their hands hundreds of times a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If harm is their concern, they may constantly check that their door is locked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If they’re worried about their relationship, they may ask their partner if everything is OK, again and again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“However, those behaviors make the person focus on the fears and doubts, and the person gets themselves into a vicious cycle. Trying to wiggle out of these doubts by performing rituals actually makes them intensify,” said Abramowitz.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How is ROCD treated?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Abramowitz says that the biggest sign of ROCD is having senseless worries and doubts about whether you love your partner, despite being happy in the relationship. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says some people with ROCD may only obsess about their relationships, while others may obsess about more than just their relationships.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The thing is that the stuff that people with OCD have an obsession about you can’t have a guarantee about. You can’t see germs. You can’t see love. Love is something that you just know when you’re in love,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, treatment for all presentations of OCD is similar. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a very treatable problem that takes hard work because you have to face your fears, but people can and do overcome it,” Abramowitz said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While a class of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can be used to treat OCD, Abramowitz says the most effective form of treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy that focuses on understanding the relationship between a person's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The type of CBT that Abramowitz says works best with OCD is called exposure and response prevention (ERP).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During therapy, one is exposed to thoughts, images, objects, and situations that make them anxious and initiate their obsessions. The response prevention teaches the person how not to engage in a compulsive behavior or ritual when they are exposed to what makes them feel anxious. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“So you’re teaching the person how to lean into their doubt and anxiety and see that they can go on with life even if they don’t know for sure that they, say, really love the person,” Abramowitz said. “They learn that they are not allowed to ask for reassurance from their partner since doing so amplifies the doubts.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One exercise Abramowitz asks a person to do who questions if they’re in love or if they’ll leave their family, is to write down the scenario. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For instance, they may write down that they come home from work, have doubts, and tell their family they’re leaving. Then drive away, and the family is heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, Abramowitz asks the patient to read what they wrote down to themselves several times in the day so they can feel their fears. They are not allowed to ask their family for reassurance, however.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Everyone in a relationship gets frustrated with their partner. That’s normal. We can all relate to thoughts of what if I just ran away from my family? A person with OCD has to learn that it’s OK to think that, and it doesn’t mean that they are a bad person or that they are going to actually do it,” Abramowitz said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ERP is exactly what Harvey practiced to face his fears.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After years of struggling with OCD symptoms, he was finally diagnosed with the condition in his early 30s. He went on to try half a dozen medications over a period of a year and a half. He chose to stop medication and focus on therapy and mindfulness strategies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“ERP helps me not worry about how many thoughts I’m having or the nature of them and helps me pass the thoughts. So when the thoughts come up instead of letting them overwhelm me, and think that they represent my true beliefs or character, I learn to say ‘that was a weird thought’ and move on. More like the general population behaves when they have weird thoughts,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to Harvey’s relationships, he says mindfulness also helps. When thoughts about whether he should leave his partner arise, he asks himself if he’s willing to leave them today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s powerful because you’re not asking yourself to answer questions like do you love them or if they’re good enough,” Harvey said. “It helps to calm my mind and perspective and reduce my expectations of what it means to be in a relationship. When thoughts pop up and I begin to judge my attractiveness to them or whether I love them or not, I let them pass, and try to be mindful by telling myself to revisit the thoughts a week from now. OCD is a chronic condition I’ll always have, but I’ve learned to live with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

en you have a serious infection or cancer, it’s natural to want it destroyed as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aggressive treatment, however, may not always be for the best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even when it initially works, antimicrobial medicines and chemotherapy can suddenly become ineffective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research suggests that in some cases where drug resistance can lead to treatment failure, containing an infection or a tumor at a tolerable level can improve patient outcomes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other cases, the traditional approach of elimination might be better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is in determining which option is likely to be successful.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Penn State University and the University of Michigan developed a mathematical analysis to identify factors that can help in that determination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their paper was published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2001110&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Acceptable disease burden&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers compared containment to eradication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Their goal was to lengthen the amount of time until drug resistance developed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can have a certain amount of infection or tumor without being sick. It’s called an “acceptable burden.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their paper, the researchers wrote that the concept of an acceptable burden is their core premise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They acknowledge this is likely to make clinicians uneasy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They recognize situations, such as bacterial meningitis, where there’s no acceptable burden. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Identifying the maximum acceptable burden is a complex problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To determine if an infection or tumor would develop drug resistance, the researchers looked at two key things.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One was the rate at which cells become resistant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other was “competitive suppression.” In cells that are responding to treatment, there’s a competition for resources. More competition can slow the spread of resistant cells. However, there’s a risk that the sensitive cells will also develop resistance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The infection or tumor was considered to be managed if it was maintained at or below the level of acceptable burden. The treatment was considered a failure if a pathogen rose above that level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that containment can sometimes double a patient’s survival time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are situations where we can be relatively sure that treatment will completely eliminate the infection or tumor, so aggressive treatment is the obvious choice,” Elsa Hansen, a research associate at Penn State, and an author of the paper, said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“On the opposite end of the spectrum, there are low-level situations like urinary tract or ear infections where a doctor may decide not to treat at all,” she continued. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The majority of cases, however, are somewhere in between,” she added, “and require hard choices that balance the damage caused by the infection or tumor and the risk of mutation with the damage caused by the treatment itself and the risk of developing uncontrollable resistance. Our analysis provides guidance for making these decisions from a standpoint of maximizing patient well-being.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How long treatment can continue before failing depends on the disease and the person. There won’t be a single solution that applies to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers' goal is to provide a basic outline so doctors and patients can make informed choices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The growing problem of resistance &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt that antimicrobial drugs have saved a lot of lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the more we use them, the more resistant infectious organisms become. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;, 2 million people are infected with antibiotic-resistant organisms every year, causing 23,000 deaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Drug resistance is a major problem in cancer and infection,” said Dr. Timothy Byun, medical oncologist at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjo.org/Our-Services/The-Center-for-Cancer-Prevention-and-Treatment.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Center for Cancer Prevention and Treatment&lt;/a&gt; at St. Joseph Hospital in California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antimicrobial drug resistance is a major public health crisis. According to WHO [World Health Organization], it is a major global health threat,” Byun wrote in an email to Healthline. “Many cancers are incurable because chemotherapy may not completely eradicate cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antibiotic resistance is a consequence of evolution, said Dr. Santosh Kesari. “We’ve had various stages of health crises over the years. Flesh-eating bacteria, for example, is very resistant.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kesari is a board-certified neurologist and neuro-oncologist, and current chair of the Department of Translational Neuro-Oncology and Neurotherapeutics at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://california.providence.org/john-wayne/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;John Wayne Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview with Healthline, Kesari said that antibiotic resistance is obvious right away when a patient doesn’t respond. Sometimes that’s the case with chemotherapy as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But here we’re talking about getting an initial response to treatment. Then resistance develops. This can take weeks or months,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Stabilizing cancer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several reasons cancer cells become resistant to treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cells mutate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sometimes the cancer is heterogeneous to begin with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You might wipe out one type, but a different type of cell starts to grow. It takes over and creates a resistant tumor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kesari explained that sometimes killing a tumor with drugs can actually promote regrowth. It may be better to just keep it stable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The question is, can we do better in preventing resistance by understanding the tumor better in the beginning? Maybe giving multiple drugs rather than one could resolve this at the start,” said Kesari.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What you’re doing in the short term may, in the long run, be bad because of the emergence of resistance. Rather than aggressive treatment up front, containment might have a better long-term effect,” he continued.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For infection, we use multiple antibiotics right away. This is to prevent resistance from happening. In cancer, combination therapy rather than a single agent is more complicated. It takes time to study each drug and combine them safely.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a significant problem,” said Kesari. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need to think about this more carefully. This paper describes an approach of containment rather than elimination. That’s interesting. But it needs to be proven in a clinical setting that this concept works using drugs that don’t necessarily kill 100 percent of cells, but contain the tumor, and with the same outcome. That includes different cancer types and types of infection. That’s what ultimately needs to be proven,” said Kesari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration’s travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries is likely to have far-reaching and unintended effects on the health of refugees, immigrants, and the American people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children needing lifesaving surgeries have already been affected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the policies could affect researchers as well as thousands of foreign-born doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That means people living in rural and low-income areas of the United States, where many foreign medical graduates provide care, may be particularly affected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shortly after the ban went into effect, shockwaves quickly spread throughout the healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 4-month-old &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/iranian-baby-previously-banned-u-s-receive-treatment-soon-n716881&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Iranian girl&lt;/a&gt; traveling to the United States for lifesaving care for a congenital heart defect was among those prohibited from entering the country. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The girl and her mother eventually received special permission from the Department of Homeland Security to fly to Oregon, but the delay in undergoing surgery means she will face a much longer recovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 1-year-old &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/world/europe/trump-travel-ban-syria-refugees.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Syrian girl&lt;/a&gt; born without an eye and a seriously disfigured face was blocked, along with her family, from coming to the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The girl had undergone two complex operations in Spain. The family had planned to resettle in the United States, and had already undergone all required security checks and interviews. Now they will need to find another country to take them in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts are worried, in particular, about the fate of refugee children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/world/middleeast/trump-immigration-ban-children.html?_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;United Nations report&lt;/a&gt;, children most in need of international emergency assistance come from five of the seven countries affected by the executive order — Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Adults were affected, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At San Francisco International Airport, an Iranian-born permanent &lt;a href=&quot;http://abc7news.com/politics/bay-area-doctor-helps-pregnant-detainee-after-travel-ban/1728892/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resident&lt;/a&gt; of the United States — six months pregnant — was taken into custody by federal officials. She was held for hours before a judge ruled that green card holders were exempt from the executive order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the ban went into effect, hospitals around the country scrambled to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/30/trump-immigration-order-hospitals/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;help patients&lt;/a&gt; who had already planned to travel to the United States to receive care for serious medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ethnicity and health&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts worry that the nature of the ban, which affects only Muslim-majority countries, increases the health risks for people of certain ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It puts immigrants, refugees, and basically anyone who may be perceived as being an immigrant or a refugee — including U.S. citizens — at risk of being perceived as a threat,” Jhumka Gupta, Sc.D., a public health professor at George Mason University, told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These groups may be targeted with harassment or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/us/islamerica-excerpt-hate-crimes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;hate crimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, said Gupta, just living in constant fear of being targeted or being perceived by others as a threat is associated with poor health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2804633/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found that after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Arab American adults who reported being abused or discriminated against because of their ethnicity showed increased psychological distress and poorer health status.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 2006 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwj.harvard.edu/papers/Lauderdale.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Demography, found that women with Arabic-sounding names who gave birth in California during the six months after 9/11 had a higher risk of having a low birth weight or preterm baby, compared with women who delivered a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That shows how discrimination and the stress associated with it, as well as other mechanisms, can impact not only the individuals, but also future generations such as babies,” said Gupta.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fate of the ban — which affects people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen — awaits a decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which heard &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-immigration-idUSKBN15L0GC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/a&gt; for the case on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But damage to people’s health may have already been done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even if the ban is lifted,” said Gupta, “the societal stigma is still there. So we have to deal with the health fallout of that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Doctors, other medical professionals impacted&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patients were not the only ones affected by the travel ban.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Jan. 28, a Cleveland Clinic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20170207/NEWS/170209856/cleveland-clinic-doctor-suha-abushamma-returns-home&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;internal medicine resident&lt;/a&gt; from Sudan, on the way back to the United States, was deported from an airport in New York and sent to Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The doctor was in the United States on an H-1B visa for workers in &quot;specialty occupations.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some doctors who are &lt;a href=&quot;http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/01/30/president-donald-trump-travel-immigration-ban-abdollah-mostafavi-sfo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;permanent residents&lt;/a&gt; of the United States were also detained as they tried to reenter the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These stories hint at one fact that many people may not realize — the United States is heavily dependent on foreign-born healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, and home care aides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4370780/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the more than 800,000 physicians practicing in the United States are graduates of medical schools outside the country — as are 10 to 15 percent of trainees in doctor residency programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Andrea Clement Santiago, director of communications and media relations of The Medicus Firm, which recruits and places doctors in the United States, about 15,000 of those doctors are from the seven countries targeted in the travel ban.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That amounts to less than 2 percent of all doctors in the United States, but many foreign-trained doctors practice in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27119328&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rural and underserved areas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than one-quarter of the international medical graduates placed by The Medicus Firm practice in rural areas. Another quarter care for patients in large cities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;International medical graduates also account for a large proportion of those that practice certain &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/2017/2/1/14470746/trumps-immigration-ban-healthcare-doctors&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;specialties&lt;/a&gt;, including geriatric medicine and family medicine. And they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20679648&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;provide care&lt;/a&gt; on par with graduates of American medical schools.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The executive order has created a great deal of uncertainty for foreign-trained medical personnel, which could harm the U.S. healthcare system well into the future.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If the immigration policy is perceived to be unfair, or too tough,” said Santiago, “it may deter all international physicians, even those not from the targeted countries, from coming to the U.S. to practice.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Big impact of immigration policies&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other experts are concerned that the travel ban will harm &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/06/travel-ban-trump-medicine-science/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;medicine and science&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-immigration-ban-may-threaten-international-work-on-disease/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;international work on diseases&lt;/a&gt; like Ebola.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/it/exclusive-trump-immigration-ban-could-stifle-health-it-workforce&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;health IT industry&lt;/a&gt;, which draws heavily on highly skilled workers from outside the United States, could also be affected. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ama-assn.org/ama-urges-trump-administration-clarify-immigration-executive-order&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Medical Association (AMA)&lt;/a&gt; expressed concern about the impact of the immigration executive order on the nation’s healthcare system, in particular in rural and low-income areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AMA has also shown &lt;a href=&quot;https://searchlf.ama-assn.org/letter/documentDownload?uri=%2Funstructured%2Fbinary%2Fletter%2FLETTERS%2F2017-2-6-Letter-of-Support-to-Coffman-HR-496-Bridge-Act.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; for a bipartisan bill that would protect young undocumented immigrants — often called “dreamers” — with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The bill would prevent them from deportation if they are doctors, medical students, or considering a career in medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These immigrants are not affected by the current travel ban, but they could be deported later if the country tightens its immigration policies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the United States shuts its doors to refugees, immigrants, and other people in need of urgent medical care, other countries are opening theirs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week in Ontario, Canada, Health Minister Eric Hoskins offered to provide healthcare for foreign-born children whose lifesaving surgeries have been cancelled in the United States due to the travel ban.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is a particular subset of children who require lifesaving surgery, so, absent that surgery, they will certainly die,” Hoskins told reporters at a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2017/02/03/ontario-to-help-young-patients-affected-by-trump-travel-ban.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The condition occurs in about 1 in 2,500 babies born in the United States each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Bethany had the rarest form of the condition, and doctors weren’t sure how best to treat it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surgery kept her alive, but it was still touch and go for months, as it is for thousands of babies born each year with critical congenital heart defects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I had surgery about every six months,” said Bethany, now 19. “It was pretty much just a part of my life. I couldn’t do what other kids do because I’d get so tired.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the time, doctors didn’t know how to treat such a complicated condition, in part because the research and experience weren’t there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In that regard, she truly is an example of how you keep someone alive until new research shows a new technique or a new treatment,” LaGesse said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A life different from other children&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;And so a couple times a year Bethany would go into the hospital for surgery to help keep her heart pumping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Bethany got to first grade, she realized that what for her was a normal life was different from other kids’ lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’d sit down and watch the other kids run,” she said. “Whenever there was recess, I had to take naps.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When she was 8, a new surgical procedure allowed doctors to close a hole in her heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My skin turned from bluish to pink, and I could breathe so much better,” Bethany said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another turning point came when she could go to Eva, Tenn., to a camp for kids with heart disease. It made Bethany feel like she wasn’t alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I made really good friends,” said Bethany.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One new friend was a girl named Sarah Theobald, who had the same conditions as Bethany. When Sarah passed away it made Bethany even more determined to fight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“She taught me to never give up, and she told me she’d be chasing purple butterflies,” Bethany said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was a phrase Sarah used a lot as they dealt with the deaths of friends over the years, said Bethany.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“To help me deal with the grief, she’d say they were chasing purple butterflies,” she remembered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bethany said the memory of her friend helped see her through several more surgeries, including a heart valve replacement in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congenital Heart Defect Awareness Week began Tuesday. As with many other survivors, each new development has led to a new surgery that improves Bethany’s life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has found reason to believe she can live a normal life and now plans to work in the medical field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I always wanted to [be a nurse], but I just didn’t think I could,” she said. “Now I know I can.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: This &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/32-heart-surgeries-and-shes-only-19/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; was originally published on the American Heart &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Association’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.heart.org/&quot;&gt;news website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Procedure May Provide Map for AFib Treatment</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/heart-health/020817_afib_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s new hope for the millions of Americans that have &lt;a href=&quot;/health/atrial-fibrillation-natural-alternative-treatments&quot;&gt;atrial fibrillation (AFib)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A team at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, using hearts from organ donors, were able to devise a method to clearly map the heart, and ultimately interrupt its ability to produce irregular heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The clear mapping of the heart allows experts to find new areas to perform helpful ablations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During an ablation, tiny cuts or burns are made to form scar tissue that can disrupt the heart’s electrical circuitry and stop irregular beats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is AFib?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;AFib is an abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia that occurs when disordered or rapid electrical signals cause the upper chambers (atria) of the heart to contract too quickly and chaotically (fibrillate).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When fibrillation occurs, it causes blood flow to become irregular and blood can collect in the atria without being pumped into the lower chambers of the heart, which is what happens in a healthy heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), someone goes to the hospital every 42 seconds due to AFib.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AFib can lead to blood clots, heart failure, stroke, and chronic fatigue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 2 percent of Americans under age 65 have AFib, while about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fs_atrial_fibrillation.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9 percent&lt;/a&gt; of those 65 and older have the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Michael Miller, a cardiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center, told Healthline that traditional treatments for AFib include low-voltage shocks (electrical cardioversion) and medications to convert the abnormal heart rhythm or reduce an excessively fast heart rate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the treatments, symptoms can persist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In these cases, the abnormal electrical activity is mapped out and the affected region is ablated or destroyed,” he said. “Catheter relation is successful in approximately 75 percent of cases but up to 10 percent may experience complications.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An AFib breakthrough?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Typically, it is difficult for doctors to know where to ablate the heart as it beats erratically 24 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vadim Fedorov, Ph.D., an associate professor who studies anti-arrhythmic treatments, and his team, devised a way to better image the heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The organ is injected with dye and placed in a dish with four high-speed optical cameras around it. A camera normally can capture about 200 recordings, but this technology records 40,000 images in 3-D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The improved imaging lets doctors find ideal areas for ablations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While this technique may pave the way for more precise ablation procedures for atrial fibrillation, and improve their success rates, [currently at about 70 percent] the approach has not been validated in real-life humans with atrial fibrillation,” Dr. Regina Druz, a cardiac imaging doctor from New York, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She noted that the hearts used in the study were donated by patients that received transplants, and they probably had structural issues that come with cardiac disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She says that Fedorov’s technique may find fewer clinical applications in actual patients with AFib because their hearts are not structurally damaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fedorov could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Druz also notes that recent evidence has indicated that AFib is an inflammatory disease that can be modified with lifestyle interventions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Over the years, we saw a drastic reduction in atrial fibrillation caused by rheumatic heart disease, as antibiotics and vaccinations took care of that,” Druz added. “However, atrial fibrillation burden remains high due to explosion of obesity, diabetes, and sedentary lifestyle.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Patients need to be provided with comprehensive lifestyle counseling, and helped to lose weight, reduce their blood pressure, normalize their cholesterol and blood sugar, as all those are triggers and risk factors for cardiac disease, including atrial fibrillation,” she said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the imaging tools developed at Ohio State may add great precision to mapping out regions for ablation, it’s important to recognize that ablation is used to treat persistent symptoms only, Miller noted. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Patients who have risk factors for stroke should remain on anticoagulant therapy [blood thinners] because the risk of stroke has not been shown to be reduced following ablation therapy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Using ‘Brute Force’ to Beat Antibiotic Resistance</title>

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/020717_antibiotics_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from University College London has demonstrated that it’s possible for antibiotics to effectively kill resistant bacteria through sheer “brute force.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s a promising step forward in counteracting antibiotic resistance, which is a growing problem worldwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antibiotics work in different ways, but they need to bind to bacterial cells in order to kill them,” Joseph Ndieyira, lead study author, and senior research associate at University College London (UCL) Medicine, said in a release. “Antibiotics have ‘keys’ that fit ‘locks’ on bacterial cell surfaces, allowing them to latch on. When a bacterium becomes resistant to a drug, it effectively changes the lock so the key won’t fit anymore. Incredibly, we found that certain antibiotics can still ‘force’ the lock, allowing them to bind and kill resistant bacteria because they are able to push hard enough. In fact, some of them were so strong they tore the door off its hinges, killing the bacteria instantly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team published their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/02/170203085156.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Scientific Reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say the research is welcome, but there’s still a lot of work to be done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A growing problem&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antibiotics can be extremely useful, but overuse has led to a rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The medical community has been sounding the alarm on the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria for years. In 2014 then-President Barack Obama signed an &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/obama-declares-war-on-superbugs-091814&quot;&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; acknowledging the threat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ndieyira outlined some other ways the international health community is working to combat the issue, noting that a 2016 United Nations &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.un.org/pga/71/2016/09/21/press-release-hl-meeting-on-antimicrobial-resistance/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt; called for a coordinated plan of action. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an email to Healthline, he added, “The World Health Organization, together with partners, has developed a global action plan to mitigate the problem of drug resistant bacteria by strengthening surveillance to better inform strategies on health interventions and detection of new trend resistance evolution, as well as the threat posed by the new strains of bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others also see the threat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a worldwide threat,” Daniel Wozniak, Ph.D., professor in the department of microbial infection and immunity at The Ohio State University College of Medicine, told Heathline in an email. “There are some infections caused by these bacteria that simply cannot be treated with conventional antibiotics, putting us in a position where we were almost 75 years ago. Without effective antibiotics, people can succumb to infections during routine surgery or chemotherapy. Unfortunately, new resistance strategies are emerging and spreading at a pace faster than we are developing means to combat infection.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;David S. Weiss, Ph.D., director of the Emory University Antibiotic Resistance Center, acknowledged the issue in an email to Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Carefully studying the characteristics of known antibiotics is of great interest as it may broadly guide the enhancement of antibiotic activity and efficacy,” he wrote. “This would likely be a faster process than the development of new antibiotics. Given the dire situation we currently face, it is critical to explore all paths and leave no stone unturned.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Forcing the lock&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ndieyira’s team at UCL studied the effects of two antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One was vancomycin, a powerful antibiotic typically used to treat MRSA and other dangerous infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other was oritavancin, a modified version of vancomycin that can be used to treat skin infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to working more quickly — oritavancin begins killing bacteria in 15 minutes, while vancomycin takes hours — oritavancin has some properties that could make it a game-changer when it comes to killing powerful antibiotic resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are three properties that make oritavancin unique,” wrote Ndieyira. “First, its molecules are good at sticking together at the surface of bacteria to form clusters. Second, its clusters bind very strongly to the surface of bacteria, and third, the clusters consequently generate the largest mechanical forces against drug resistant and drug-susceptible bacteria, which can lead to bacteria cells being killed more rapidly compared to vancomycin.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, these unique clusters literally tear the surface of the bacteria apart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wozniak applauded the research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I found the work quite compelling and interesting,” he wrote. “The multidisciplinary approach involving biological, physical, and mathematical sciences to tackle this problem was impressive. The authors bring a new perspective on drug-bacteria interactions by studying mechanobiology, the forces at play during antibiotic-target binding. For me, the most important advance was the premise to utilize mathematical modelling prior to, or integrated with, the synthesis of new antibiotics to help ensure potent activity of drugs. This work also has implications outside of antibiotic development, since the concept applies potentially to any drug-target interaction.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A fine balance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medical experts acknowledge that combating antibiotic resistant bacteria can create an “arms race” when bacteria grows stronger and more resistant as the medication used to combat it becomes more effective.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There has to be a balance between the need and usage, so as to avoid a future arms race,” acknowledged Ndieyira. “For example, overuse of oritavancin when it is not absolutely necessary, or using it in agriculture, might lead to the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We frankly have been in an arms race with microorganisms throughout history,” wrote Wozniak. “Because bacteria can grow to such high numbers, and because they grow much faster than our cells, acquisition of resistance is an evolutionary inevitable outcome, I’m afraid. The trick is to use antibiotics prudently and often in combination with other drugs that target different bacterial processes, and for us to remain healthy so that our immune systems can fight infections during antibiotic treatment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ndieyira says his team will continue their research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our next step is to use these findings to develop new antibiotics, and modify existing antibiotics, so that they are effective against multi-drug resistant bacteria,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would happen if the doors suddenly closed on the 650 health centers across the United States operated by Planned Parenthood?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s certainly a topical question with the introduction of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/075cd2c9-efc7-412a-afba-66fcbcb72cb7/C4E3F05D9D425CB3F92CD8663ECCE920.1.30.17-protect-funding-for-women-s-health-care-act.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; in Congress last week by two female Republican legislators.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The legislation would take away the $500 million a year the federal government provides for Planned Parenthood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would also repeal a law that prohibits states from defunding the nonprofit organization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those tax dollars represent about 40 percent of Planned Parenthood’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/2114/5089/0863/2014-2015_PPFA_Annual_Report_.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;operating budget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if that money wasn’t recouped, Planned Parenthood would probably still operate, albeit with fewer centers and a lower capacity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, what if opponents did achieve their ultimate goal of putting Planned Parenthood out of business?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those opponents say women would be able to get services such as cancer screenings, Pap smears, and counseling by going to other community health centers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps more importantly to them, women would have trouble finding a facility that performs abortions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They would have a difficult time getting an abortion and I would celebrate that,” Eric Scheidler, executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, supporters of Planned Parenthood say hundreds of thousands of women would lose access to important reproductive and other health services. Even more would face reduced services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, they say, abortions would actually increase because the number of unwanted pregnancies would go up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cuts, they add, would come on top of the changes being sought by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/paul-ryan-republicans-still-committed-repeal-replace-obamacare-strategy-n716986&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Republican leaders&lt;/a&gt; in the Affordable Care Act (ACA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The primary goal is to block all women from reproductive health services,” Terry O’Neill, president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What Planned Parenthood provides&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to Planned Parenthood, opponents focus on the abortion services the organization provides.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anti-abortion groups say Planned Parenthood performed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lifenews.com/2016/01/28/planned-parenthood-made-1-3-billion-killing-324000-babies-in-abortions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;324,000 abortions&lt;/a&gt; in 2014.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scheidler calls the organization “the nation’s largest abortion chain.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He notes its clinics perform 35 percent of abortions done in the United States compared to 1 percent of all Pap smears and 2 percent of all breast exams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s what they specialize in,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supporters of Planned Parenthood take a different view of the figures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall, Planned Parenthood’s clinics see 2.5 million patients a year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They note the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/planned-parenthood-at-a-glance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;organization’s clinics&lt;/a&gt; provide 360,000 breast exams and 270,000 Pap smears annually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The clinics also perform 4.2 million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). That includes 650,000 HIV tests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, it provides 2 million people with birth control information and supplies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They estimate Planned Parenthood helps prevent 579,000 unwanted pregnancies every year, and only 3 percent of its health services involve abortion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is a vital and valuable resource for our adolescents,” Dr. Cora Breuner, a Seattle pediatrician, and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Adolescence, told Healthline. “There’s quite a bit that they do that is not contraceptive.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The question of federal funds&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Planned Parenthood has been around for 100 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It began receiving federal funds in 1970. In 1976, federal funds were limited to services that are not abortion-related.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scheidler said although the $500 million in annual federal funds aren’t directly used for abortions they keep Planned Parenthood in business.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It helps keep the lights on,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scheidler also believes Planned Parenthood is a corrupt organization, noting a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.justice.gov/usao-edtx/pr/planned-parenthood-pays-43-million-settle-allegations-unnecessary-medical-care&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Medicare fraud case&lt;/a&gt; in Texas the group settled in 2013, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/15/health/planned-parenthood-undercover-video/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 controversy&lt;/a&gt; involving undercover videos taken at a Planned Parenthood clinic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says the organization doesn’t deserve taxpayer money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supporters wholeheartedly disagree.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say Planned Parenthood provides vital healthcare services and helps lower the cost of other tax-funded programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Public opinion appears to be on their side.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2421&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quinnipiac Poll&lt;/a&gt; taken in late January, 62 percent of respondents opposed cutting off federal funds for Planned Parenthood. That rose to 80 percent when those questioned were told federal funds aren’t used for abortions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Supporters say Planned Parenthood could operate without federal funds but not in the way they currently do.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In the short term, it would be extremely damaging,” said O’Neill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amy Friedrich-Karnik, senior federal policy advisor for the Center for Reproductive Rights, told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-planned-parenthood-survive-without-federal-funds/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CBS News&lt;/a&gt; it would be difficult for an organization as large as Planned Parenthood to continue operating without that federal money.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There would be a shift in how Planned Parenthood operates,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A world without Planned Parenthood&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scheidler and other abortion opponents reject the notion that women would have no other place to go for healthcare services without Planned Parenthood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/marking-a-new-era-committed-to-protecting-our-most-vulnerable/article/2613098&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; in the Washington Examiner, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Rep. Diane Black (R-Tennessee), the co-sponsors of the bill to defund Planned Parenthood, said there are 14 federally qualified health centers (FQHC) for every one Planned Parenthood facility.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scheidler said those and other centers can be found on the website &lt;a href=&quot;http://getyourcare.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GetYourCare.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said his group supports giving every dollar taken away from Planned Parenthood to other healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to cut off one single woman from getting the services she has been getting from Planned Parenthood,” Scheidler said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at Planned Parenthood declined a request from Healthline for an interview, but their supporters say there is no way these other organizations could pick up the slack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.plannedparenthood.org/files/4314/8183/5009/20161207_Defunding_fs_d01_1.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;54 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Planned Parenthood clinics are in rural or underserved areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They add Planned Parenthood is the only safety-net family provider in 21 percent of counties where it operates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 65 percent of Planned Parenthood patients are 150 percent or below the federal poverty line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 60 percent are recipients of Medicaid or Title X programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, they say, Planned Parenthood clinics have extended hours, same-day appointments, and shorter waits than other publically funded healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/09/08/quantifying-planned-parenthoods-critical-role-in-meeting-the-need-for-publicly-supported-contraceptive-care/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; commissioned by the Congressional Budget Office estimated 390,000 women would lose access to services and another 650,000 would have reduced access within a year if Congress blocked Medicaid patients from Planned Parenthood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O’Neill said some women would go elsewhere without Planned Parenthood but others wouldn’t. Some women would also forego preventative healthcare services such as cancer screenings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Many women would die unnecessarily,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, O’Neill predicted there would be an increase in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), maternal mortality, and infant mortality, as well as a decrease in “well woman” visits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She added there would also be an uptick in unwanted pregnancies, leading to more abortions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Women aren’t going to stop having abortions,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She called anti-abortion groups’ claims that women would find care elsewhere as “alternative facts,” noting that dentist’s offices are listed on GetYourCare.org as healthcare providers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some women have been going public recently with their stories on how Planned Parenthood helped them in times of need.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/opinion/columnists/rekha-basu/2017/01/27/basu-defunding-planned-parenthood-could-increase-abortions/97137524/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; late last month before Iowa legislators.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One woman said her doctor refused to prescribe birth control pills that could have helped her with an ovarian cyst, saying it was his religious belief that an unmarried woman shouldn’t have contraception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/healthcare/316469-planned-parenthood-is-essential-to-me-and-millions-more&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; on The Hill website, Jen. D. Rafanan, a board member of the Feminist Women’s Health Center in Atlanta, wrote about an “urgent reproductive health issue” she experienced in 2012 when her menstrual period wouldn’t stop.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The county health center didn’t have an available appointment for three months, so Rafanan went to Planned Parenthood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Before I went to Planned Parenthood, I felt helpless. Afterward, I felt like I had someone on my side,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another woman posted a note on a Healthline social media page saying it was Planned Parenthood that helped to switch her from the pill to an IUD to alleviate chronic headache symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I so appreciate their care and availability,” the woman wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O’Neill said there are thousands of other stories like these.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an example, she said a 16-year-old girl who wants to become sexually active can go to Planned Parenthood without worrying her confidentiality will be breached.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Breuner, of the AAP, said relationship counseling is one of the most important services Planned Parenthood offers to teenage girls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said girls, especially those from low-income households, can learn how a healthy relationship should function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The counseling can teach her how to say “No,” and how she should expect to be treated,” Breuner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Starpoli, a gastroenterologist, and associate director of esophageal endotherapy at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Common mistakes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways people sabotage their health while enjoying themselves during the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Number one on the list is alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nutrition experts told Healthline there are several ways people abuse this privilege.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most obvious is the amount. Drinking throughout the Super Bowl is a sure path to Hangover Highway.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another is downing alcoholic drinks before you eat. Taking in liquor on an empty stomach allows alcohol to course even more quickly into your bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ingrainhealth.com/about-katie.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Katie Ferraro&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian, and assistant clinical professor at the University of San Diego and the University of California, San Francisco, says the majority of sick calls on Monday will be from drinking too much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You don’t want to focus on the wrong thing,” she told Healthline. “In the end, it’s probably the alcohol that is going to do you in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s not to say food consumption won’t be a problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ferraro says there is not only a lot of food at Super Bowl parties, there’s also a lot of unhealthy snacks that are high in sodium, fat, and calories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The typical Super Bowl cuisine isn’t focused on health,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://susanweinernutrition.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Susan Weiner&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and nutritionist, says there are foods served at Super Bowl parties that people don’t normally consume.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think quantity is really the problem, but it’s especially true with foods you don’t typically eat,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it’s not just upset stomachs that are the result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Starpoli said people can also have acid reflux-related problems. The most common is heartburn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said this is a particularly serious problem for people prone to gastroesophagael reflux disease (GERD), but it can affect anybody who is overindulging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It can create a perfect storm,” he said. “People aren’t used to consuming these types of things in such a short period of time.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Time is also a factor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ferraro points out that the Super Bowl is longer than most regular season football games, giving people more opportunity to abuse their bodies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to the game, the post-game celebration doesn’t end until around 11 p.m. EST. Even on the West Coast, that’s 8 p.m.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In either case, it doesn’t give people a lot of time to settle down before they go to bed and then wake up the next morning to go to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Super Sunday advice&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, how do you avoid Super Sick Monday?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the alcohol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ferraro recommends beginning your party with a glass or two of water before you take that first sip of liquor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After that, drink some water in between each of your alcoholic beverages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Starpoli agrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Staying hydrated is incredibly important,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the food, Weiner suggests having some alternative dishes to the bacon-cheese snacks and beefy sandwiches.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps one or two party-goers can be assigned to bring vegetable and fruit dishes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“At least give yourself a fighting chance,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weiner also suggests not standing next to the food table while you watch the game or talk with other guests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Put some food on a napkin or plate and walk to the other side of the room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you’re standing next to it, you’re more likely to eat it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, stop eating and drinking as the end of the game draws near. That’ll provide you with a better chance of getting adequate rest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also things you can do on Monday to help yourself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, make sure you toss out any leftover food from the party. If you don’t, you’re likely to snack on those unhealthy items.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, drink a lot of water on Monday. It’ll help re-hydrate you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And do your regular exercise for that day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Super Bowl Sunday can set up some not-so-good habits for the next few days,” Weiner said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever stayed up watching late night movies, you’ve probably seen commercials promising miracle total body makeovers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You know the kind. “Just 30 minutes of exercise a day, three times a week, and you could have a totally ripped body in as little as six weeks.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It sounds good, but the truth is, there’s no quick way to get fit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If a gym, trainer, or class promises to make all your dreams come true in six weeks, run — don't walk — in the other direction,” New York-based certified personal trainer Lisa Snow, president of &lt;a href=&quot;http://onthemendfitness.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;On the Mend Customized Fitness and Massage&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even “natural” exercisers won’t see fitness miracles any time soon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some people seem to put on muscle at a much quicker pace than others — although nobody is going to look like Vin Diesel overnight,” said Justin Fauci, a certified personal trainer and co-founder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://leanmuscleproject.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lean Muscle Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you doubt that six weeks isn’t enough time to get fit, take a look at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2004/05000/Training_Vs__Body_Image__Does_Training_Improve.9.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2004 study&lt;/a&gt; by researchers at the University of Wisconsin, La Crosse, which was published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers put a group of 25 sedentary men through a six-week exercise program — either three 20-minute cardiovascular sessions each week, or three 30-minute high-intensity, total-body strength training sessions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, it sounds a lot like those miracle fitness commercials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A group of panelists rated the men’s appearance at the start and end of the study based on photos. After six weeks, the ratings were unchanged. Even the men’s ratings of their own appearances were pretty much the same after six weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also, objective signs of fitness — like percent body fat, number of pushups, and oxygen efficiency — didn’t improve over the course of the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So if six weeks isn’t enough time to get in shape, how long does it take?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Time depends on goals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The answer to this fitness question depends, in part, on what you mean by “in shape.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How long it takes to see fitness results will vary depending on what your goals are,” Eliza Kingsford, director of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wellspringcamps.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wellspring Camps&lt;/a&gt;, and author of “Brain-Powered Weight Loss,” told Healthline. “Are you looking to improve time? Get stronger? Lose weight? Lose body fat? The answer to how long it will take to get fit will vary for each one of those goals.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A beginner wanting to run a 5K race will take less time to get in shape than someone training for their first marathon or triathlon. And they will need a different training program than someone getting ready for a weeklong backpacking trip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In general, though, you will start to “feel” better long before you see major fitness results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For someone starting out, I notice that within two weeks they can start feeling the benefits of exercise,” Jamie Logie, a personal trainer who runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.regainedwellness.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wellness Regained&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This might mean being less out of breath when you climb stairs or run to catch the subway. Or being able to play with your grandchildren in the back yard without getting tired.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although you might not have a “ripped body” yet, these small changes shouldn’t be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The mental benefits of getting active are even more important than the external changes we are all so concerned about seeing,” Samantha Clayton, senior director of Worldwide Fitness Education at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.herbalife.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Herbalife&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This includes increased motivation and confidence to keep coming back to your workout until you start seeing physical benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you have been out of shape, or not working out for 10 years — or forever — it will generally take about two months of working out most days of the week to get to a moderate level,” New York-based Nikki Glor, creator of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nikkifitness.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NikkiFitness&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;videos, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if you exercise regularly, over time you will gain even more fitness benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“At six to eight weeks you can definitely notice some changes,” said Logie, “and in three to four months you can do a pretty good overhaul to your health and fitness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strength-specific results take about the same amount of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For a client who is already in good cardio shape but just wants to learn how to lift weights safely, three months is usually a reasonable timeframe,” said Snow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, how long until you are sporting a “ripped body”?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you're consistent about working out and dieting properly for a full year, and you weren't significantly overweight to begin with,” said Fauci, “then after one year you can expect to sport a lean, muscular physique with a visible six pack.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Getting fit to compete&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not everyone likes getting fit just for the sake of getting fit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For them, there are any number of outdoor races to choose from — 5K or 10K running races, marathons, half marathons, or 100-mile bicycle rides. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are also triathlons, Tough Mudders, Super Spartans, and other obstacle races for people who like variety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this kind of specific fitness goal, it’s even more important to not rush getting in shape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you are preparing for an event or race, please be over-prepared,” James Shapiro, a certified personal trainer with New York-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://primalpower-fitness.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Primal Power&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline. “If you plan to participate in an endurance event like the Spartan race and have never jogged five miles, it's time to start three to four months before. Our bodies do get stronger, but you want to run past the finish line, not crawl to get there.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many training programs to help you get in shape for these races, but expect to spend at least two months on pre-race training, clocking miles three to six days each week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That extra time will be worth it, especially for beginners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17186304&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2007 study&lt;/a&gt; in the European Journal of Applied Physiology, researchers put a group of untrained adults through a nine-month half-length and full-length marathon training program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, people in the program had increased their cardiovascular fitness — VO2 max — by 24 percent, and their running speed by 29 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if you prefer noncompetitive outdoor activities like backpacking, kayaking, or mountain biking, expect to put in solid miles to get in shape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We find that it takes about four to five full days of backpacking to get into hiking shape,” Steve Silberberg, owner of Massachusetts-based &lt;a href=&quot;http://fitpacking.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fitpacking Weight Loss Backpacking Adventure Vacations&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are full eight-hour days, back-to-back, with a fully loaded pack. It may sound daunting, but lots of beginners have walked this path before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Many people can get right off the couch and start backpacking,” said Silberberg. “The second day is the toughest because the first day’s enthusiasm has waned and you already have sore feet and muscles.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Factors that affect fitness&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These, of course, are general guidelines. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many things along the way can speed up or slow down your progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How fit you are when you get started is one factor that I’ve personally seen affect people’s individual results timeline,” said Clayton.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The type of exercise you choose also matters and it will affect you differently if you are a beginner or coming off an illness or injury.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you’re not comfortable with exercise, or perhaps are being cautious because of an injury, you are going to get different results from walking for 90 minutes per day than someone who is already used to exercise and decided to try a HIIT [high intensity interval training] program,” said Kingsford.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beginners, though, may progress faster simply because they are starting lower down the fitness ladder and require less exercise to challenge their body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Beginners see huge jumps in strength across the board every week with proper training,” said Fauci.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, what you put into an exercise program also determines what you get out of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a perceived exertion scale of one to 10, “if you only feel comfortable exercising at a level six, you are going to get different results than someone who is comfortable exercising at a level nine,” said Kingsford.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/1108370&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2007 study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers placed sedentary, overweight, or obese women into three groups — exercising at 50 percent, 100 percent, or 150 percent of the recommended energy expenditure level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women who worked out at the highest intensity level saw an 8 percent improvement in their cardiovascular fitness after six months. Those at the lowest intensity level saw a 4 percent increase in fitness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An 8 percent increase in fitness doesn’t seem like a lot, but if you’ve been inactive for a long time, it can be huge.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you crank up the intensity even more, you’ll get faster results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We see fitness results from our students within about two weeks,” Tina Angelotti, fitness director of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kravmaga.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Krav Maga Worldwide&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline. “Our students work at very high levels of intensity in our Krav Maga self-defense, fitness, and fight classes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are a beginner, or new to higher-intensity workouts, you might need to work up to this level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you work too hard too soon, you risk injury or quitting from the stress,” said Clayton. “But if you don’t work hard enough, you won’t see results. So find your balance and know that healthy and fit is not a race nor a destination.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Getting out of shape&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once your exercise routine becomes a habit, you’ll probably find that it’s easier to stick with it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But an injury, illness, or even life can easily derail your workouts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Life circumstances will always throw you off your plan at some point,” Rob Williams, performance coach and trainer for &lt;a href=&quot;https://eas.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EAS Sports Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, “but the more important thing is to get back to your program and be in it for the long run.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Often, cardiovascular fitness is the first to go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you're highly trained and decide to take a break from exercise, your cardio is going to be the first and fastest to decline. It will drop significantly after only a few weeks of inactivity,” Tyler Spraul, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and the head trainer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://exercise.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Exercise.com&lt;/a&gt;, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.lww.com/acsm-msse/Fulltext/2011/07000/Quantity_and_Quality_of_Exercise_for_Developing.26.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American College of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, physiological changes — like blood lipoproteins, ability to use glucose for energy and body composition — can occur one or two weeks after you stop exercising.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6511559&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1984 study&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Applied Physiology: Respiratory, Environmental and Exercise Physiology also found that when endurance athletes stopped training, their VO2 max dropped by 7 percent within the first 21 days of inactivity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This stabilized after 56 days of no exercise. And after 84 days of inactivity, the athletes still had a higher VO2 max than people who had never trained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Muscle strength may last longer during a break.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10949019&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2000 study&lt;/a&gt; in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found that young people lost just 8 percent of their strength after 31 weeks of inactivity. Older people lost 14 percent of their strength during that time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of the loss of strength occurred between 12 and 31 weeks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even small breaks may not affect your overall strength progress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21771261&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2011 study&lt;/a&gt; in Clinical Physiology and Functional Imaging, beginners who took a three-week break in the middle of a 15-week bench press program achieved similar results by the end of the study as beginners who worked out the entire way through.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So once you build a foundation of strength, it stays with you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you undergo resistance training, you permanently change the physiology of your muscle cells — even if you stop training for long periods of time,” said Fauci. “This makes the process of regaining strength and size after a long break from the gym much quicker.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is just as true for overall fitness.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Everyone is going to be different when it comes to seeing results after a break from working out,” said Williams, “But the longer and more consistent you’ve been working out and training, the less of an impact a break will have on you.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Minimizing losses during breaks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news is you can minimize fitness losses during a break by continuing to exercise at some level, even if it’s less than what you were doing before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the ACSM, you can maintain your current level of strength, performance, and health benefits with “as little as a single session per week of moderate- to hard-intensity exercise.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What you choose to get you through a break depends on your circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you stopped exercising because life got in the way, you might need to squeeze in physical activity wherever you can — do bodyweight resistance exercises throughout the day, take the stairs instead of the elevator, or bike to work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are injured, you may have to modify your workouts significantly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I encourage students dealing with an injury — depending on the severity of the injury — to continue to come and train, but we obviously modify their workout around the injured body part,” said Angelotti. “For example, a student with a shoulder injury can still come and work out their lower body so that they don't get completely deconditioned.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s also important to work with a doctor or physical therapist to develop a program that will keep you active, but still let your body heal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who are coming back from an injury also “need to learn to trust the injured joint again,” said Snow. “Favoring the uninjured side for months or years after graduating from therapy only increases the risk of a new injury somewhere else in the body.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have been inactive for several weeks, it is often safest to start fresh — working with your current level of fitness and health, not where you were before the break.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And for that, you’ll need lots of patience, the kind that got you in shape in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“After giving birth to my first son it took me four months to get back to fit and after triplets it took me 18 months,” said Clayton. “It’s all about one step at a time and allowing your body to adapt slowly — this is often the best and most sustainable approach.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That’s why they are used in situations such as post-surgery recovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hurd said the downside to opioids is they are more addictive than cannabinoids. In addition, it is nearly impossible to overdose on cannabinoids, while it is possible to overdose on opioids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you look at both drugs and where their receptors are, opioids are much more dangerous, in part because of the potential for overdose — the opioid receptors are very abundant in the brainstem area that regulates our respiration, so they shut down the breathing center if opioid doses are high,” Hurd said in a statement. “Cannabinoids don't do that. They have a much wider window of therapeutic benefit without causing an overdose in adults.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She noted that younger people can overdose from consuming too much edible medical marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hurd said that some people addicted to heroin might be better off using cannabinoids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said cannabinoids have the potential to reduce the users’ cravings and symptoms with less chance for addiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hurd noted that states that have passed medical marijuana laws have noticed a decrease in opioid prescriptions and opioid overdoses since legalization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The experts weigh in&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several experts interviewed by Healthline found merit in Hurd’s findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Thomas Strouse, medical director of the Stewart and Lynda Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), said the study brings up some “very interesting” points and issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strouse, who also oversees a palliative care program, said some of his patients who experience acute pain from surgery or chemotherapy need to stay on opioids.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, some patients who experience long-term chronic pain might be better served using components of marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He agreed that the effects from cannabinoids are not as serious as they are from prescription painkillers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Marijuana dependency is milder compared to opioids,” Strouse told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He and Hurd did agree that people under the age of 25 whose brains are still developing should avoid marijuana-based treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) also saw promise in Hurd’s research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s important to note that the focus of this paper is on cannabidiol (CBD) — a nonpsychoactive component of the marijuana plant — and that preclinical and preliminary evidence in human trials suggest that it may have therapeutic potential for treating some components of an opioid (and other) addictions,” Dr. Susan Weiss, NIDA’s director of the Division of Extramural Research, said in an email to Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weiss added that the best way to administer such treatment is through “purified extracts of the plant or synthetic formulations of cannabinoids that can be reliably produced and administered through nonsmoking routes.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), also agreed with the study’s basic findings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He told Healthline that cannabinoids have been proven to be less addictive than opioids, tobacco, and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said people who use marijuana products rather than opioids usually came out ahead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you weigh the ‘pot positives’ against the ‘pot negatives,’ you come out with a net positive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experts also urged the scientific community to continue researching marijuana’s therapeutic advantages.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hurd noted that so far the policy on marijuana laws has been made at the ballot box, not in the nation’s laboratories and university halls.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Strouse had the same concern.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I hope we are guided by science on this issue,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Do Wearable Devices for Babies Cause Anxiety for Parents?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/021816_vitamindbaby_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mary O’Connell Ripley and her husband, John, brought home their newborn daughter slightly more than a year ago, the couple was undoubtedly nervous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many first-time parents, their anxieties were relieved a bit when they decided to invest in a baby video monitor so they could easily check on their infant while she slept.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It definitely brought me piece of mind,” O’Connell Ripley told Healthline. “We could just look at the monitor and see how she was doing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Peace of mind isn’t an unreasonable aspiration for any parent with regard to their child’s safety. Baby monitors are often considered the first line of defense in that quest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As O’Connell Ripley mentioned, they allow parents to easily keep tabs on their child — when they sleep, when they wake up, and when they cry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2598780&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt;, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), cautioned parents about turning to a specific type of monitoring device as the be-all and end-all of keeping track of your child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Concerns over constant monitoring&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These so-called smart devices, or wearable devices, are designed to monitor your baby’s movements at night, analyze your baby’s sleep, and keep you constantly updated on your baby’s heart rate and oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These devices are usually linked to apps on smart phones that send alarms to parents when a condition, such as the position, breathing, or temperature of the baby, changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The JAMA authors say many parents appear to be using these devices as a means to prevent sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). But in the end they are only subjecting themselves and their babies to unwarranted health scares.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Despite the lack of publicly available evidence, supporting the safety, accuracy, and effectiveness, or the role of the monitors in the care of well infants, sales of the products are brisk and the market is expanding,” JAMA stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jesspreet Gowan of the Stanford Children’s Health Pediatric Associates, told Healthline that she agrees with the concerns of the JAMA review.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said that wearable devices for infants may sound like a great idea, in theory. But unless your child has a serious medical condition that warrants constant monitoring, parents are only setting themselves up for more stress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You have alarms going off and parents rushing to the ER,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any parent who enters an emergency room and reports that their baby isn’t breathing properly will have to watch their child undergo a number of tests that can range from chest X-rays to a hospital stay, Gowan added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She said the fear of SIDS is real, so she understands why parents would turn to a wearable device to help alleviate that worry. But they need to understand that healthy babies, just like adults, don’t always sleep soundly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What these monitors are really looking at is sleep apnea,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But apnea is not correlated with an increased risk of SIDS, Gowan added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These monitors have not been shown to decrease risk of SIDS,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The evolution of baby monitors&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;First generation baby monitors took hold in the 1980s and looked like walkie-talkies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They broadcasted through short wave radio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the early 2000s, video monitors came into favor, giving parents a bird’s-eye view of their child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, parents and caregivers can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of baby monitoring devices. &lt;a href=&quot;http://amazon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; boasts dozens of devices. A quick search for “baby monitoring devices” on Google produces a seemingly endless list of page results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are only a handful of the more sophisticated smart devices on the market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Owlet gives parents real-time feedback on heart rates and oxygen levels. It looks like a little sock that parents slip on their baby’s foot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The website promotes the idea of “peace of mind” for parents, but it also lists a disclaimer that “this device is not intended to cure, treat, or prevent any disease or health condition, including, but not limited to, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Mimo Smart Baby Breathing and Activity Monitor is best described as onesies with the device attached near the belly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It monitors “real-time breathing” and alerts parent of any changes in breathing and activity, such as body position and temperature through a connected app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MonBaby calls itself a breathing and rollover monitor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It snaps onto your baby’s clothes, similar to antitheft devices used on clothes in department stories. Parents can set up their desired alerts on the accompanying app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Parental anxiety &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s important to note the American Academy of Pediatrics is not in favor of parents using smart monitoring devices. These products are also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gowan said infants with chronic lung disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or infants who require ventilation at night, would likely benefit from a smart monitoring device.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But then the pulmonologist is prescribing it and parents are instructed on what to do,” she said. “In this case it’s very controlled.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parents who have healthy babies and are using a smart device are essentially on their own, she added, with no one to help them interpret the alarms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This leads to the anxiety,” Gowan said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;O’Connell Ripley said that was the reason she and her husband made the conscious choice to not purchase a smart monitoring device.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unless there was a known medical issue,” she said, “I think it would increase your anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gowan said she has no issue with parents employing a video monitor. She also hasn’t had any parents ask her about wearable devices for their child.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But she expects that to change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When that happens Gowan said she plans to educate parents on the JAMA findings and strongly encourage parents to employ the tactics that are known to prevent SIDS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Safe sleep, that has been known to reduce SIDS. Back sleep, no blankets, no toys in the crib, all of those things,” she said. “It’s important for us to emphasize those are the things to do to protect your baby.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, medical students were taught there are 78 organs in the human body. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January, that number was revised with the announcement of a &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/new-organ-in-human-body#1&quot;&gt;new organ&lt;/a&gt; called the mesentery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the digestive tract, the mesentery transports blood and lymphatic fluid between the intestine and the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until recently, it was believed to be made of up separate structures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But researchers in Ireland have revealed the mesentery is in fact one continuous structure, bringing the organ count for the human body up to 79. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what else don’t we know about the human body? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthline asked a few experts to share their theories on some long-held questions about our complicated machinery. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why do we have different blood types? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The major blood types are A, B, and O.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Type O is the most common blood type, and type AB is the least common. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blood type can be determined by the types of sugars that stick to blood cells. Each individual has enzymes that are particular and will only add certain types of sugar to the blood cell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blood types can also be determined by the presence or absence of antigens and antibodies in blood and blood plasma. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the reason why humans have different blood types in the first place remains a mystery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Les E Silberstein, a spokesperson for the American Society of Hematology, and a hematologist at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, describes it as an “enigma.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is speculated that specific blood types and blood type antigens have evolved to fulfill a particular function,” Silberstein told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One theory is that people who evolved in a specific location may develop a specific blood type to protect them against diseases common in that area,” he added. “For example, the majority of African-Americans are group O, which is considered to be more resistant to certain forms of malaria.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why do we have fingerprints? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fingerprints have long been used as markers of human identity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fingerprint analysis forms an important part of forensic science and criminal investigation. Among other things, they can be used to identify individuals who are deceased. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The exact reason we have fingerprints has puzzled researchers for decades. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Roland Ennos, Ph.D., a professor of biological sciences at the University of Hull in England, says there are three potential reasons humans have fingerprints. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first is that fingerprints help with touch sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Touch receptors are found in the ridges [of fingerprints] and these can amplify strains in the skin, so increasing sensitivity. But this could be a secondary use. Many other areas of our hands and feet, the palms and soles also have similar ridges, and we don't use them for sensitive touch,” he told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second possibility is that fingerprints help improve grip, though Ennos is unconvinced this is the case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The problem with this is that the friction of soft, rubbery materials such as skin rises with the area of contact. Fingerprints will reduce contact area, so should actually reduce friction on smooth surfaces. However, they could increase friction on rougher surfaces by getting into the troughs of the surface,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The third possibility is that the ridges on fingerprints could help prevent blisters. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Blisters tend to occur when shoes rub on areas of the feet which don't have ridges, such as the heel and tips of the toes, but it's hard to prove,” Ennos said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why do we yawn? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself needing to yawn directly after someone else has? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Robert Provine, a neuroscientist, and professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, and author of the book “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674048515&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Curious Behavior: Yawning, Laughing, Hiccupping, and Beyond&lt;/a&gt;,” says contagious yawning is a basic, neurologically programmed social behavior. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Yawning may be a primitive form of empathy that binds tribal members together and coordinates their physiology, such as synchronizing arousal and bedtimes. Diminished contagion, whether from yawning or laughing, may be a novel measure of social disorders as in autism or schizophrenia,” he told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But why do we yawn in the first place? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The best starting point to this question is considering when we yawn,” Provine said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We yawn most just before bedtime, after waking, and when becoming bored. All of these situations involve ‘state change’ — shifting from one condition to another, whether from sleep to wakefulness, wakefulness to sleep, or alertness to boredom. Also, it has been suggested that yawning may cool the brain. Yawning is a vigorous, body-wide act that is ideal for stirring up our physiology and facilitating these shifts.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not just humans that yawn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most vertebrates (animals with backbones) yawning starts near the end of the first trimester of prenatal development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contagious yawns also occur in highly social animals such as chimpanzees and animals that travel in packs, like dogs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What causes us to laugh? &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever heard someone laugh so hard they begin to sound like a chimpanzee, you have evolution to thank for it. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you tickle a chimpanzee, its laughter sounds like panting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The sound of laughter came to symbolize the physical play that triggered it,” Provine explains. “Laughter indicates, ‘This is play, I'm not attacking you.’ The ancestral primate ‘pant-pant’ evolved into the human ‘ha-ha’ that involves a chopped exhalation, as in speech.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea of “play” has evolved for humans from rough play of the chimpanzees to conversation and other high-order cognitive stimuli.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But laughter still remains highly social.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We laugh thirty times more often in social than solitary situations. When alone, without the vicarious social stimuli of media and our imagination, laughter almost disappears,” Provine said. “Want more laughter in your life? Spend more time in playful encounters with friends, family, and lovers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

'Baby Boxes' Show the Importance of Helping New Parents

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/021816_vitamindbaby_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a page from Finland’s baby care book, New Jersey will soon begin offering “baby boxes” to parents of all newborns in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cardboard boxes are large enough — and come with a tight-fitting sheet and hard mattress — to provide a safe sleep space for the baby’s first couple of months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The boxes are also filled with essential items for newborns — a onesie, diapers, baby wipes, and nipple cream and breast pads for breast-feeding mothers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The program is a partnership between the state's Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board and manufacturer The Baby Box Company. They expect to hand out about 105,000 baby boxes this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Funding is provided by a grant from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phillyvoice.com/new-jersey-become-first-state-send-new-parents-home-baby-boxes/&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the first statewide baby box program in the United States. But similar efforts have been undertaken in other cities, including one started last year at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phillymag.com/be-well-philly/2016/05/06/baby-boxes-temple-university-hospital/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Temple University Hospital&lt;/a&gt; in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These programs attempt to reduce the risk of accidental suffocation and strangulation — which account for 25 percent of the approximately 3,500 cases of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/sids/data.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID)&lt;/a&gt; in the United States each year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) accounts for 44 percent of the SUID cases. The rest have unknown causes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-infant-death-syndrome/basics/risk-factors/con-20020269&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Risk factors for SIDS&lt;/a&gt; include infant sex and age, secondhand smoke, and premature birth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;SIDS, though, is not related to unsafe sleep.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“SIDS deaths are deaths where we have no explanation for why this previously healthy baby died,” Dr. Elizabeth Murray, a pediatrician at University of Rochester Medical Center’s Golisano Children’s Hospital, told Healthline. “But unsafe sleep deaths are 100 percent preventable.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Creating a safe sleep space&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These “preventable deaths” occur in communities across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I work in a pediatric intensive care unit and unfortunately we still see this happen,” Dr. Shoba Srikantan, a pediatrician and critical care specialist for Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Florida, told Healthline. “We have a few cases every year of a child who died while sleeping in a bed with a parent. A child, whose parent put them to sleep on a pillow, who suffocated on the pillow. A child who fell asleep breast-feeding on their mom and suffocated that way.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If parents and doctors keep in mind the dangers of unsafe sleeping conditions, said Murray, it “will help to make it very real for the families that are learning this information.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With baby boxes and other sleep devices, parents also need to keep in mind other safety tips, like “making sure that there’s nothing in the crib — that there are no baby bumpers, that there are no blankets — that the baby is on their back,” said Murray, “and no co-sleeping in an adult bed.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Toys, pillows, and pets should also be kept out of the baby’s sleep area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And if parents are using gadgets to keep track of their baby, they shouldn’t get lulled into a false sense of safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you still don’t have a safe sleep environment, and you put your baby on a pillow — even with a baby monitor … I’ve seen children suffocate and die that way,” said Srikantan. “I can’t emphasize how it’s so important that safety is paramount.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Educating parents&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In countries like Finland, which has been handing out baby boxes to parents since the 1930s, “it’s considered a rite of passage and a very proud thing that the parents engage in,” said Murray.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But this is not the only safe sleep option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Other communities have other projects to get Pack 'n Plays or actual cribs to families in need if they don’t have it,” said Murray.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These resources, though, can only do so much for the safety of infants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The one thing we’ve definitely seen in our community is that it’s not a lack of access to a safe sleep device,” said Murray. “It’s a choice to not use it. So you have to overcome that barrier.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which is why the New Jersey program also tries to educate parents about newborn care through an online curriculum and quiz.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These messages are especially important for new parents, who may feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Parents are focused on so many things when they have a baby,” said Srikantan. “How’s my baby going to feed, how do I give a bath, how much is too much? There’s so much that you’re trying to absorb at once.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The baby box program is part of a larger conversation about newborn health, one that parents can start long before their baby arrives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Srikantan suggests that expectant parents “find a pediatrician that you can really partner with,” and remember that “no question is a silly question to ask your pediatrician.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/topic_centers/Depresion/400x400_Famous_Faces_of_Depression-8-Gwyneth_Paltrow.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It only takes one glance at the tabloid rack to realize that when famous people talk, people listen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Celebrities often use their platform to discuss personal health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Much of their health advice is considered questionable, from putting a jade egg in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.health.com/sexual-health/jade-egg-goop&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;private area&lt;/a&gt;, to espousing the belief that &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/children-still-no-evidence-vaccines-cause-autism-032913&quot;&gt;vaccines cause autism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, these comments tend to gain traction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be sure, not all celebrity health advice is bad, but experts say the comments of the rich and famous should be taken with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;They’re not doctors&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A celebrity’s fame can provide a big platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Because celebrities have a big audience, they can have a big effect on people’s behavior,” Steven Salzberg, Ph.D., Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of biomedical engineering, computer science, and biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University, told Healthline. “And if they give out bad advice, that can be very dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To find bad celebrity health advice, one doesn’t have to look far.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jenny McCarthy is as well-known for her &lt;a href=&quot;http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1888718,00.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anti-vaccine activism&lt;/a&gt; as she is for her Playboy pictorials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ben Stiller gave well-meaning — but what some experts called flawed — advice regarding &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/men-to-get-prostate-cancer-screening-but-should-they&quot;&gt;prostate cancer screenings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to Gwyneth Paltrow, it’s hard to know where to start.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past, the Oscar-winning actress has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-bad-health-advice-2015-10&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted tips&lt;/a&gt; on her website about health-related topics from sunscreen to cleanses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, Paltrow recommended that women put &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/news/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-advice-vaginal-jade-eggs-doctors-warning/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;jade eggs&lt;/a&gt; in their vaginas to improve their health and sex life. That advice was criticized by a number of medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add to all this the dozens of celebs, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/news/a63124/kardashian-weight-loss-tips-you-should-never-follow/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kim and Kourtney Kardashian&lt;/a&gt;, who offer weight-loss tips.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, says it’s risky for the general public to put their trust in celebrities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Celebrities are seen through the lens of their fans as trusted messengers,” Benjamin told Healthline. “The challenge we have is making sure that those messages are correct and that those celebrities are well-informed. Frankly, sometimes, they’re simply wrong.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the anti-vaccine movement, Salzberg says that anti-vaxxers like McCarthy tend to see a conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Vaccines are one of the most effective treatments we have to prevent disease and save people’s lives, and that’s why people go into medicine. They don’t go into it because they want to hurt people. That’s just a crazy and nutty kind of suggestion, but that’s exactly what Jenny McCarthy and other anti-vaxxers like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are promoting now,” Salzberg told Healthline. “So there’s no evidence that there’s any conspiracy, but they state it and assert it, and people listen because they have a big platform. It’s frustrating. I’m not going to have the kind of audience that R.F.K., Jr. has. He had a meeting with Donald Trump.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benjamin points out that sometimes it isn’t an individual celebrity, but rather an entire industry, that spreads a harmful message.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The tobacco industry, for many, many years, encouraged and even paid studios and others in the entertainment industry to promote tobacco, which is, of course, a harmful product,” he said. “So the medical community has worked very hard with the TV and film industry to try and get them to remove the use of tobacco products from movies, where role models are seen smoking.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Good advice, education&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite some of the more dubious health claims celebrities have made over the years, there are precedents for famous people using their platforms to advocate for responsible health decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benjamin cites actor Michael J. Fox’s battle with Parkinson’s disease, and his subsequent advocacy for research into the disorder, as a particularly noteworthy example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also brings up some other examples, noting, “Katie Couric, whose husband had colon cancer, had her own colonoscopy on TV. The Marlboro Man, Wayne McLaren, became an anti-tobacco advocate after being diagnosed with lung cancer. Angelina Jolie, whose genetic makeup included a strong possibility of breast cancer, had a preventive double mastectomy. A celebrity can have a positive impact.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salzberg says education is the key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think that the only real solution is a long-term one, to educate people better starting in grade school. They need to pay attention to science and evidence-based medicine,” says Salzberg. “The other thing that I’ve been blogging about for years — and other people, too — is that I think we need to train individuals, starting as early as elementary school, to be skeptical about claims they hear on TV or on their computer screen. They don’t have to become experts on science and medicine — they just can’t, it requires too much background training. But they can be skeptical.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Benjamin says that individuals can make informed choices by making sure their health advice is coming from a reputable source.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In this era, what often happens is a celebrity will bring something up, and people will begin googling it. It can begin a national conversation. Now, some of that conversation is informed and some of that information isn’t informed,” he said. “And so what has to happen is that health organizations need to weigh in and become part of that conversation so people can find trusted information from organizations like the Red Cross, American Heart Association, American Cancer Society, and I’d like to say us at the American Public Health Association. There are also federal agencies like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Salzberg points out that the scientific community has made significant headway in educating the public, particularly when it comes to anti-vaccine rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think the momentum has flagged,” he said. “The current anti-vaccine movement was at its peak in the early and mid-2000s, but in the scientific community we’ve been working very hard to counter that, because it’s very harmful to public health. So I think it’s losing momentum. But it’s a constant fight.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I suggest they switch them around. Include olive oil or avocado oil.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She noted that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/1016p32.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Today’s Dietitian magazine&lt;/a&gt; investigated some of claims attributed to coconut oil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While there's a possibility that MCFAs [medium-chain fatty acids] may behave differently in the body than longer-chain saturated fats, there's no direct evidence that coconut oil increases insulin sensitivity or can be helpful in the prevention or treatment of diabetes in humans. The American Diabetes Association considers coconut oil a saturated fat to be limited,” the magazine reported.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Can it really clean teeth?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported last spring that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/coconuts-go-upscale-boosting-price-of-conventional-coconut-oil-1460017362&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;coconut oil prices&lt;/a&gt; had risen nearly 20 percent in a month, largely due to the growing popularity of specialty products such as coconut water. Coconut water is being marketed as a replacement for sports drinks like Gatorade. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The result is a shake-up in supply chains from farms to store shelves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In some supermarkets, coconuts are being sold with pull tabs to be drunk like beer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the celebrities touting the benefits of coconut oil is actress &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/gwyneth-paltrow-oil-pulling-to-make-your-teeth-white-using-coconut-oil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gwyneth Paltrow&lt;/a&gt;, who has said it whitens teeth and improves the complexion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3137807/Would-clean-teeth-coconut-oil-Study-finds-ancient-Indian-technique-really-DOES-benefit-mouth-health.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt; in England consulted a dentist about claims for assorted alternative methods of cleaning teeth, including the following:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A 3,000-year-old Ayurvedic way to clean teeth is to swish a tablespoon of oil (usually coconut, sesame, or olive oil) around your mouth for 20 minutes every morning. The coconut oil is said to stick to the oil in the cell membranes of any bacteria in your mouth, so when you spit it out, you are ridding your mouth of unwanted microorganisms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Turns out there is no scientific evidence at all that “oil pulling,” as it’s called, will remove bacteria or whiten teeth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The science of saturated fats&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;True believers, however, say there’s science to back up their claims.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Coconut oil is made by pressing the fat from the white “meat” inside the giant nut. About 84 percent of its calories come from saturated fat. Compare that to 14 percent of olive oil’s calories from saturated fat, and 63 percent of butter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This explains why, like butter and lard, coconut oil is solid at room temperature with a long shelf life and the ability to withstand high cooking temperatures,” says registered dietitian Lisa Young, Ph.D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that coconut oil is high in saturated fats, it’s made up mostly of medium-chain triglycerides, or MCTs, which some say the body handles differently than other fats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MCFAs, which always are saturated, are defined as having six to 12 carbons. Long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) have more than 12 carbons and can be saturated or unsaturated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two behave differently in the body. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and MCFAs are more easily absorbed than LCFAs because they're more water soluble.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I was in school, coconut oil was big no-no because it was a saturated fat,” Blake recalled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it’s popular again, although most professionals in the field don’t think much of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fans of coconut oil point to studies that suggest the MCT saturated fat in coconut could boost HDL (“good”) cholesterol. This, they claim, makes it not as bad for heart health than the saturated fat in foods like cheese and steak or products containing trans fats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it also raises your LDL (“bad”) cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But just because coconut oil can raise HDL cholesterol doesn't mean that it’s great for your heart,” Young said. “It’s not known if the rise in beneficial cholesterol outweighs any rise in harmful cholesterol.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s Freeman’s point.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He says there is no proof coconut oil does anything other than clog arteries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He points to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/Saturated-Fats_UCM_301110_Article.jsp#.WJEuOUUrKlM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from the American Heart Association, which recommend saturated fat be limited to no more than 13 grams a day. That’s the amount found in about one tablespoon of coconut oil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not a recommended oil by any of the guidelines that I know of. In general, it can contribute to cardiovascular disease risk because of its very high saturated fat content,” Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

p&gt;Negotiating drug prices under the Medicare program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Allowing more medications to be imported from other countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speeding up the drug approval process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those are the basic tenets of President Donald Trump’s plan to reduce prescription drug prices in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The president reiterated some of those positions as well as unveiling a proposal to “streamline” the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) when he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-drug-pharmaceutical-manufacturing-234423&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;met Tuesday morning&lt;/a&gt; with pharmaceutical executives and lobbyists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump took a more conciliatory tone with the pharmaceutical leaders than he did a couple weeks ago when he accused the industry of “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-drugpricing-idUSKBN14V24J&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;getting away with murder&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After today’s meeting, both sides said they would work together to try to make drugs more affordable for consumers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For that to happen, there are two big questions facing the White House.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is will Congress approve the president’s plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second is will the plans work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What the president proposes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump advocated a plan to allow officials in the Medicare health program to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Current U.S. law prohibits such talks. Other countries, including Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, allow government officials to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/socheata-poeuv/america-does-not-negotiat_b_5516353.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;negotiate drug prices&lt;/a&gt;. Some experts say that has kept prescription prices down in those countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medicare covers more than 55 million older Americans. The Medicare and Medicaid systems spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$325 billion&lt;/a&gt; on prescription medicine in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump mentioned this proposal again during Tuesday’s meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kurt Mosley, vice president of strategic alliances for Merritt Hawkins consultants, said this strategy could be an effective one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It could bring pharmaceutical companies back to the table,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the campaign, Trump also floated a plan to make it easier to import prescription drugs from other countries.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said this would increase competition and lower drug prices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The president didn’t mention this plan specifically during Tuesday’s meeting, but he expressed interest in global trade and tax policy that he said could benefit U.S. drug manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re gonna be changing a lot of the rules. We’re going to be ending global freeloading,” Trump was quoted as saying by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-drug-pharmaceutical-manufacturing-234423&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt;. “Foreign price controls reduce the resources of American drug companies to finance drug and R&amp;amp;D innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/31/14453740/trump-medicare-prescription-drugs&quot;&gt;one critic &lt;/a&gt;said the president had caved in to the pharmaceutical industry by backing off price negotiations and instead promising less regulation and lower taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others were more optimistic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After the meeting, The Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing (CSRxP) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csrxp.org/csrxp-applauds-trump-administrations-focus-on-lowering-prescription-drug-prices/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;applauded&lt;/a&gt; the president’s focus on reducing drug prices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rodney Whitlock, vice president of health policy at ML Strategies, and a consultant to CSRxP, told Healthline this week that changes such as the Medicare negotiations and the import rules could have an impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The ones on the table are very significant steps,” Whitlock said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the president also discussed an overhaul of the FDA drug approval process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said he’ll be naming an FDA commissioner soon who will streamline the agency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Trump also expressed an interest in possibly allowing some drugs to be approved before they’ve been proven safe, according to Politico.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We're gonna be getting rid of regulations that are unnecessary, big league,” the president said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FDA recorded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DrugInnovation/ucm483775.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;22 “novel drug” approvals&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, down from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DrugInnovation/ucm430302.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;45 approvals&lt;/a&gt; in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mosley told Healthline last week that quicker approvals, especially for generic drugs, could boost the free market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The president can do a lot of things,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What else can be done&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whitlock said CSRxP would like to see the president and Congress go even further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His organization calls for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csrxp.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transparency, competition, and value&lt;/a&gt; in the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whitlock said one of the key ways to boost transparency is for drug companies to disclose how much they have spent on research and development for specific medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said that would let the public know when these companies have recouped their costs on drug development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said that could prevent hikes such as last year’s increase in &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/cost-of-epipens-forcing-allergy-sufferers-to-syringes&quot;&gt;EpiPen prices&lt;/a&gt; or the 2014 leap for the hepatitis C drug &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/new-hepatitis-c-drug-stirs-controversy-041114&quot;&gt;Solvadi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It could produce some self-moderating of prices,” Whitlock said. “We want to try to create market-based solutions.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another tactic CSRxP is pushing involves hearings later this year on user fees the pharmaceutical company pays the FDA to review their drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whitlock said Congress could use this reauthorization as leverage to force the pharmaceutical industry to make changes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) think the solutions lie in ensuring patients have access to medications and instituting more “patient-centered care.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an email to Healthline, officials at PhRMA noted their industry spends more than $70 billion a year in research and development of drugs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Breakthrough medicines are revolutionizing how we treat disease, saving patient lives, reducing healthcare costs, and improving public health,” the statement read. “Today, medicines are purchased in a competitive marketplace where large, sophisticated purchasers aggressively negotiate lower prices.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The industry association said it intends to work with the federal government in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We look forward to working with the administration and Congress to advance proactive, practical solutions to improve the marketplace and make it more responsive to the needs of patients,” the association stated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The organization has launched a $100 million multiyear advertising campaign called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.phrma.org/press-release/america-s-biopharmaceutical-companies-launch-groundbreaking-multi-year-initiative-heralding-new-era-of-medicine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GO&lt;strong&gt;BOLDLY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to showcase what it calls “the industry’s unsung heroes driving cutting-edge advances in science.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, CSRxP officials see this as nothing more than a distraction from the industry’s price gouging.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“No amount of advertising will make hardworking families forget the consequences of their out-of-control drug costs,” a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csrxp.org/csrxp-on-phrmas-multimillion-dollar-pr-campaign/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on the group’s website says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whitlock added that getting changes through Congress could be difficult given that the pharmaceutical industry has one of the top three largest lobbying groups in Washington.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s an uphill battle, but it’s a battle worth fighting,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Experimental Treatment Provides Hope for Infants with Cancer

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/092016_childrencancer_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An experimental treatment has saved the lives of two infants with difficult to treat leukemia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two children, 11 and 16 months old, each experienced complete cancer remission within 28 days of receiving treatment. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Diagnosed with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), both infants had exhausted all other treatment options.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ALL is an aggressive type of cancer that begins in immature white blood cells called lymphocytes. Without treatment, ALL can be fatal within months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cancer.org/cancer/leukemia-in-children/detection-diagnosis-staging/prognostic-factors.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;, children with B-cell ALL who are between the ages of 1 and 9 have better cure rates. Infants under 1 year old tend to have a poorer outlook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two infants given the experimental treatment have both been cancer-free for more than a year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research was published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/374/eaaj2013.full&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How T cell treatment works&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When other methods such as chemotherapy don’t work, there’s a newer leukemia treatment that involves using a patient’s own T cells. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The T cells are removed and manipulated with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that instruct them to attack ALL cells. Then they’re returned to the patient’s blood. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, most infants during their first year haven’t developed enough healthy T cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Waseem Qasim, professor of cell and gene therapy at Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College in London, and his colleagues, wanted to find a solution to this problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unable to get enough T cells from the infants, they decided to use donor blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through gene editing, they created functional T cells that could evade immune system attacks in unmatched recipients. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The T cells were then infused into the infants’ blood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two months after the procedure, one infant developed mild graft-versus-host disease in the skin. It cleared up following a bone marrow transplant and steroid treatment. The other infant had no complications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s the first time doctors have ever treated cancer with altered T cells from a donor. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The doctors showed it’s possible to create universal, or “off-the-shelf,” therapies from altered donor T cells. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experiment could lead to big advances in hard to treat ALL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The promise of off-the-shelf T cells &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With no need to match patients with donors, patients could be treated more quickly and more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Engineered T cells are the most important story in difficult to treat leukemias and lymphomas,” said medical oncologist Dr. Jack Jacoub in an interview with Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A lot of progress has been made in this type of treatment. It’s an area that has excellent promise and definitely needs to be considered,” said Jacoub, the director of thoracic oncology at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.memorialcare.org/services/cancer-care/cancer-care-orange-coast-memorial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MemorialCare Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center in California.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This type of lymphoblastic leukemia is a very bad disease,” he added. “There’s often little to be lost. This is the case with these two infants. They were provided therapy on a compassionate basis. All other therapies failed, so there was nothing to lose. They would have succumbed to this illness.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The paper’s authors suggest there are limitations in getting lymphocytes in young patients. They have a less mature immune system. They don’t have enough T cells, and that’s a problem,” said Jacoub.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The authors are implying we don’t need to go to the patient or have a donor. We don’t need either route,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Next steps for researchers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In these two infants, they’ve showed they can do it,” said Jacoub. “It’s only two [patients] and they tried it because there was nothing else. But it’s not even a phase I trial structure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jacoub notes that the paper was published in a small journal that may not be widely received throughout the field of hematology. He’s fairly certain, however, that this paper is on the radar of scientists involved in the field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also worthy of note is the small sample size. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We don’t know how the next patients will do. This is just an observation, but an exciting one that must be expanded,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jacoub suggests the need for more collaboration with larger institutions with research infrastructure, more of these types of patients, and the expertise to manage this disease. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Whether it will go to phase I trial is a big leap. It will have to involve more than one institution. Right now, it’s just an observation of two patients. We won’t be rushing out to try to do this now, but this is how things start,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jacoub sees a lot of potential in this type of treatment. But there’s a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The U.K. trial would have to be reproducible in the United States to see if this is feasible. With more scientific scrutiny and oversight — if we can reproduce it — it could be enormous. Barriers would be overcome,” he said. “They’re taking available technology a few extra steps. The technology is there. If it really was a true effect and can be reproduced in different settings and countries, it could lead to widely available therapeutic options. If this observation could be accurately reproduced, we’ll probably know in the next year or two. That’s how fast this field moves.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jacoub said this is exciting news for patients and their families. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not widely available or the current standard of care. But families of these patients are usually medically savvy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s all for families bringing it up with their physicians.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s OK if their doctor hasn’t seen this published report. Copies of this journal may not go everywhere. Usually these things happen in collaboration. Emails to scientists and institutions start discussions. So they should definitely bring it up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
lt;p&gt;Do medical professionals treat women differently when it comes to painful ailments?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some people sure think so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others aren’t convinced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although there is evidence to support an unconscious gender bias against women — especially in emergency room or pain management settings — there are also many people who say that such a bias doesn’t exist. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An October 2015 article in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/emergency-room-wait-times-sexism/410515/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/a&gt; gained a lot of traction in the discussion surrounding gender bias in healthcare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was titled “How Doctors Take Women’s Pain Less Seriously.” The article provided a first-person account from a husband who observed the way his wife was being treated in a hospital setting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The op-ed essay stated, “Women are likely to be treated less aggressively until they prove that they are as sick as male patients.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another article titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/opinion/sunday/women-and-the-treatment-of-pain.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Gender Gap in Pain&lt;/a&gt; was also widely circulated.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was originally published in 2013 in the New York Times, and concluded that “pain conditions are a particularly good example of the interplay between sex (our biological and chromosomal differences) and gender (the cultural roles and expectations attributed to a person).”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sexism in medicine?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond individual stories, there are also studies that conclude the possibility that this gender bias does exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, a study by the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law was published in &lt;a href=&quot;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=383803&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SSRN&lt;/a&gt;. The study, called “The Girl Who Cried Pain: A Bias Against Women in the Treatment of Pain,” attempted to identify why it was that women seemed to “report more severe levels of pain, more frequent incidences of pain, and pain of longer duration than men, but are nonetheless treated for pain less aggressively.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study stated, “… not only that men and women communicate differently to healthcare providers about their pain, but that healthcare providers may respond differently to them.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This study found that female patients more likely to have their pain described as emotional or psychogenic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hl-poll&quot; style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9652131.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://polldaddy.com/poll/9652131/&quot;&gt;Do you think medical professionals treat women differently?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bias — although it may be an implicit or unintentional one — seems to be particularly pronounced in emergency settings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Heart disease is the number one killer of women in the United States. In addition, experts say that many times women experience &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-disease/art-20046167&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;different symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of a heart attack than men. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In general, the consensus among documented patient experiences and the studies presented, is that often women, while more likely to report symptoms to a doctor, are often viewed as more emotional than men.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Avoiding the pain&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This isn’t to diminish men’s experience with pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One rheumatologist, who didn’t want his name used, told Healthline that most doctors don’t like treating people with chronic pain at all, regardless of sex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pain is complex, hard to treat, and there aren’t a lot of good answers on how to best manage pain in people with chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, taking the general stigma against people with chronic pain out of consideration, women seem to face &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/opioids-problems-for-chronic-pain-patients&quot;&gt;more skepticism or indifference&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to their symptoms than men do given the same circumstances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Women report doctors being condescending or &lt;a href=&quot;https://psmag.com/is-medicine-s-gender-bias-killing-young-women-4cab6946ab5c#.irqdgft58&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not taking symptoms seriously&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes women say they are told their symptoms are all in their heads — a refrain that doesn’t seem to always translate to men’s healthcare experiences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92516/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2011 Institute of Medicine report&lt;/a&gt; on the public health impact of chronic pain found that not only did women seem to suffer more often from pain, but they also had a higher pain tolerance. Nonetheless, the study concluded that women’s reports of pain were more likely to be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can be problematic, since pain is self-reported and is relatively subjective. To properly treat and control pain, doctors have to trust that the person is describing pain accurately and in a trustworthy manner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gender bias against women is not solely an American phenomenon nor is it only “sexist” male doctors. This is bias that may potentially exist on a global scale, coming from both male and female healthcare providers. It can play a role in many situations from emergency care to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/how-sexism-and-implicit-bias-hurt-girls-and-womens-health_b_7736866.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;childbirth&lt;/a&gt; and OB-GYN care to chronic pain management. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simply put, according to Dr. Mary O’Connor of the Mayo Clinic in a 2015 &lt;a href=&quot;https://myheartsisters.org/2013/08/27/unconscious-bias/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, “Women do not always receive the same medical care as men.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This “built-in bias” can create more serious problems in an emergency room.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What do patients think?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A survey of 2,400 women conducted by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://nationalpainreport.com/women-in-pain-report-significant-gender-bias-8824696.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Pain Report&lt;/a&gt; concluded that 90 percent of women with chronic pain feel the healthcare system discriminates against women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About 65 percent of respondents felt that doctors of either gender took their pain less seriously simply because they were women. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Amiee Lesko of Pennsylvania, told Healthline, “My PCP is a woman, been seeing her for 10ish years. She's younger and the absolute best. She takes time to listen and never discounts any of my thoughts, feelings, or complaints. I totally trust her opinion. When I had a health scare in 2015, I had seen a handful of physicians, all male. They all brushed my complaints off as ‘mental’ since they couldn't see anything. I basically felt like brushed off as a ‘silly girl.’ Now when I'm looking for a specialist, I always try to find a female provider first.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lauren Karcher, another Pennsylvania resident, had similar experiences but noted not all doctors treat young women this way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It depends on the doctor I think ... but I have been treated by specific ones in a manner that they felt I had no idea what I was talking about and refused to listen to me,” she told Healthline. “My mom went with me to an appointment and even said to the doctor, ‘I don't feel like you are taking her very seriously.’ He said, ‘Look at her, she is smiling and bubbly, how could she be in so much pain?’… I am always smiling and bubbly, even when I'm pain, that’s just me.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tami H., who lives with rheumatoid arthritis, told Healthline, “I'm not able to speak for others. However, I have felt and seen the discrimination in doctors’ offices and the work force. My personal experiences have made me leery of new doctors and nurses … and God forbid I have to go to the ER! That’s more frustrating than just putting up with whatever is wrong with me.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These women aren’t alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alice Sparks of Florida is living with psoriatic arthritis. She told Healthline, “There is absolutely a gender bias. The typical stereotype is that women overreact to pain and symptoms while men do not seek medical care until it is absolutely the final measure. I can look back, prior to my diagnosis, when I presented with classic symptoms and was told that it was ‘stress’ or ‘depression.’” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lucy Bowen of Texas said that in her situations, going with a female doctor helped. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I purposely chose a female rheumatologist to treat my pain to bypass this issue,” Bowen told Healthline. “It has made a world of difference. I used to feel like I had to justify what I was feeling but now there is so much less pressure.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This feeling of being judged or talked down to can leave some women feeling mistrustful of, or intimidated, by their doctors. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some male patients say they have noticed a bias against women.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I can't tell you that I know this to be true. However, I have listened to many ladies talk about how their doctor doesn't seem to believe the intensity of their pain,” Jose Velarde, an advocate living with rheumatoid arthritis, told Healthline. “I have seen three rheumatologists, a pain specialist, and my GP. Not once has anyone suggested I wasn't in the pain I say I'm in. Not once have they questioned my need for the pain meds.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But some people say they don’t see any discrimination or differences in treatment or care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tavie George, who has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, told Healthline, “This question of gender bias against women kind of made me laugh because I always think female doctors are way more rude than male doctors … I think being young has been more of a discrimination against me than being a female. I also have received discrimination over having Medicare and Medicaid at such a young age.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I do think,” she added, “women in general have an emotional habit of getting their feelings hurt in unneeded situations when they are in pain, emotional or physical.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lindsay Paige Tonner, who has rheumatoid arthritis, told Healthline, “Bias hasn't been the case for me. I've been treated with care and respect throughout from both male and female doctors. Having said that I have been told that if I say I'm in a lot of pain then I really must be as I have had a baby so know what I'm talking about.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What do professionals think?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Women are seen as less pain tolerant, but actually I see the opposite in prehospital medicine. Men always ask for pain meds while women seem to wait to ask. Maybe women have the general thought process that we will think they are whiners or med seekers and abusers,” DeNell S., a healthcare worker, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Brenda Unhajer, a nurse from Pennsylvania, told Healthline, “From the other side of the bed, I can tell you there is a gender bias in healthcare. In an acute versus chronic situation, many women having acute chest pain are often overlooked and given anti-anxiety medications before receiving treatment, or in addition to, being worked up for a cardiac problem.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She continued, “One of the biggest frustrations I face as a provider [non-physician] is the ‘golden standard.’ While we promote individualized care, it's far from that. Evidence-based practice has changed a lot of things for the good, but treatment-wise, I think it's hindered a lot from the physicians' standpoint.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carrie Wood of Pennsylvania disagreed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve worked in the ER for six years and I can say I never treated or saw a patient treated differently for their gender,” she told Healthline. “We treated based on facts, tests, and symptoms, and there were at least 10 different providers. Nor have I ever been treated differently in my healthcare field because I am a woman.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But she added that this may vary from person to person or institution to institution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As cultural norms shift and gender identities and values are challenged, this may continue to be a topic of conversation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medical schools are beginning to address the nuances of gender in healthcare and also teach med students about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/23/Quick_Safety_Issue_23_Apr_2016.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;implicit bias&lt;/a&gt;, whether against women, people of color, or the LGBTQ community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/010715_dietguidelines_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardening may not be on the minds of most Americans as cold temperatures continue to persist across much of the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But when the warmer temperatures move in and everyone wants to get outside, making sure to use safe lawn and garden products is important. The chemicals found in some of those products can be harmful to your health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.6b00301&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in Chemical Research in Toxicology&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found that chemicals in some gardening products and insecticides can affect melatonin receptors and put humans at a higher risk for metabolic diseases, including diabetes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Exposure to these chemicals could put people at higher risk for diabetes and also affect circadian rhythms,” Rajendram Rajnarayanan, Ph.D., an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo in New York who served on the research team, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is the first report demonstrating how environmental chemicals found in household products interact with human melatonin receptors,” Margarita L. Dubocovich, Ph.D., a professor at the University at Buffalo in New York, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dubocovich is a renowned authority on melatonin receptor regulation. Her work has expanded the understanding of how melatonin affects human health, including sleep disorders, metabolic disease, and drug addiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Looking at toxic chemicals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carbaryl, a popular insecticide used in the United States, but banned in several countries, is one of the chemicals in the study. It has been linked to &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/wide-range-of-pesticides-contribute-to-dwindling-bee-population-101315#2&quot;&gt;declining bee populations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study’s other chemical, carbofuran, is a toxic carbamate insecticide that has been banned for use on food crops in the United States since 2009, but is still used in many countries, including Mexico.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We found that both insecticides are structurally similar to melatonin and that both showed affinity for the melatonin MT2 receptors that can potentially affect glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion,” said Marina Popovska-Gorevski, who co-authored the study while a student at the University at Buffalo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That means that exposure to them could put people at higher risk for diabetes and also affect sleeping patterns,” Popovska-Gorevski said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of now, federal agencies do not assess environmental chemicals for their ability to disrupt circadian activity — something highlighting the importance of this study, Rajnarayanan added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Other disrupters lurk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;These aren’t the only chemicals that can affect the human body, though.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rajnarayanan said Bisphenol A (BPA) and DDT are known to disrupt the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;endocrine system&lt;/a&gt; and even cause cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some of the insecticides do tend to persist in the environment and have the potential to bypass metabolism and chemical breakdown,” he said. “Exposure to these chemicals does more harm than those that are broken down chemically or by our body rapidly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749114002802&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2014 study&lt;/a&gt; in Environmental Pollution&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;found insecticides known as neonicotinoids (similar to nicotine) that were used on soy and corn crops were commonly found in streams throughout the Midwest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That same year, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neurology.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published in Neurology reported on &lt;a href=&quot;/aging-pesticide-exposure-tied-to-parkinsons-risk-020314#2&quot;&gt;11 pesticides&lt;/a&gt; that increase a person’s likelihood of developing Parkinson’s disease by up to six times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another article in &lt;a href=&quot;http://archneur.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1816015&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt; linked DDT exposure to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. A year earlier, an Environmental Health Perspectives report linked the chemical to &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/women-exposure-to-pesticides-increases-endometriosis-risk-110513&quot;&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2015, more research tied these chemicals to &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/long-banned-pesticides-still-causing-men-to-produce-mutant-sperm-110415#2&quot;&gt;infertility&lt;/a&gt; and low sperm count.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pinpointing pesticides&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rajnarayanan said his team is developing a test that could detect environmental toxicity and circadian disruption activity to establish potential health risks of other chemicals they have compiled into a database.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His study was funded to pinpoint new environmental diabetogens (chemicals that can cause diabetes) and obesogens (chemicals that can cause obesity). Research on them is “a relatively new research area,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to tend to your garden, but do keep an eye on labels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Not all insecticides are bad for us,” Rajnarayanan said. “However it is imperative to study the chemicals that are extensively in use, especially the ones that can get into our air, food, and water.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using organic products could be an alternative to harmful chemicals, but they may not be as effective for extensive farming practices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;John F. Tooker, Ph.D., an associate professor at Penn State College of Agricultural Sciences, said some data show things like spiders can do a good job controlling pest insects in crop fields. This is part of the practice known as integrated pest management.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The main way to do that is to avoid unnecessary insecticide applications,” he told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rajnarayanan said that scientists can provide data and examine risks, but regulators and policy makers will need to get involved to advise people on risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
p&gt;In the days following the terrorist attack in New York on Sept. 11, 2001, Bart Zagami spent his time at Ground Zero helping with the task of rescue and recovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zagami, 61, a New York State Supreme Court sergeant at the time, was in his office just blocks from the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan when the terrorists struck. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next few days were something he will never forget.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The whole area was covered in debris,&quot; he told Healthline. &quot;Gigantic piles of dust and rebar was what we were on, passing buckets. Please don't make it sound heroic. We did what we did.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nine years after the attacks, as he was about to retire, Zagami was diagnosed with stage 4 marginal zone lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma for which there were few effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zagami didn’t know it at the time, but his cancer was likely caused by his exposure to the enormous amount of toxins that filled the air at Ground Zero for weeks and months after the terrorist attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A rough treatment road&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cancer was a difficult thing to face as he began his retirement. But Zagami, a New York native who still lives around the corner from the Brooklyn house where he was born, was ready for the fight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But in 2014, he learned that he was allergic to Rituxan, the successful monoclonal antibody drug used to treat lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It was his only remaining treatment option approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), other than chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About six months after his last Rituxan treatment, Zagami had an MRI that showed his spleen was getting larger.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It continued to grow, to the point where it took up his entire midsection and weighed more than 8 pounds. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After having his spleen surgically removed, Zagami recovered again, started exercising, and began feeling better. But within a year, his blood levels were unhealthy again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Taking a chance with a clinical trial&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zagami’s future was uncertain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But then his doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York told him about an experimental treatment with a drug called ibrutinib.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They said it held great promise for his type of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ibrutinib, the generic name for the drug Imbruvica, is an oral therapy that inhibits the function of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a target for therapy of B cell diseases that includes several types of lymphoma. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The drug, which was developed by Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company, and Janssen Biotech Inc., causes fewer side effects than traditional chemo because fewer healthy cells are damaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Zagami’s doctors told him about the treatment, it had not yet been approved by the FDA for his type of cancer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors couldn’t offer Zagami any guarantees that the drug would work on him. But they showed him the positive early data. And he embraced the opportunity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enrolling in the clinical trial was an easy decision for Zagami to make. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My doctors were confident that this drug could help me,” he said. “There was no nervousness. It sounded better than the alternative.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Better results than anticipated&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the trial, which consisted of a daily dose of four pills, Zagami had few side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just some blistering on his skin and minor bone and body aches, both of which were temporary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blood tests showed his body was responding positively to the medication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Today, more than two years later, Zagami is doing well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He continues to take the drug every day — three pills now instead of four.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While he may never be in complete remission due to his type of cancer, he has what is referred to as a partial but durable remission. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His blood counts remain normal. He’s back to working out with weights and walking five miles a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m not sick anymore. I feel terrific,” Zagami said. “I get up in the morning and work out with weights every day, then I read the newspapers online, go for five-mile walk, and go shopping. My wife still works. Three days a week I watch my two granddaughters.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More clinic trial options available&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While clinical trials like the one Zagami opted for have always been an important part of cancer care in America, they’ve become an option for more people than ever before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are so many new treatments now in the pipeline, everything from targeted therapies like ibrutinib to immunotherapies. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And the risk factors that once scared patients away from clinical trials seem to be diminishing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patients are becoming increasingly aware that this new generation of cancer treatments is moving away from the traditional chemotherapy model, and they are often more effective than anything patients have seen in the past.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are generally safer than drugs of the previous generation, although some are still accompanied by serious but typically short-lived side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, the FDA &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.abbvie.com/news/us-fda-approves-imbruvica-ibrutinib-as-first-treatment-specifically-indicated-for-relapsedrefractory-marginal-zone-lymphoma-mzl--rare-type-non-hodgkins-lymphoma.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that because of the positive responses to ibrutinib in people with MZL, like Zagami and others in the Sloan Kettering trial, the agency has granted “accelerated approval” for the drug for this type of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Ariela Noy, a hematologic oncologist at Sloan Kettering, and lead investigator of the study, told Healthline that “Imbruvica’s approval helps fill a significant treatment gap for previously treated MZL patients who will benefit from a targeted therapy rather than a traditional chemotherapy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Darrin Beaupre, head of early development and immunotherapy at Pharmacyclics LLC, added, “Imbruvica’s approval for patients with MZL is significant. Now patients have the option of a well-tolerated, effective treatment in a disease that had no prior approved therapies.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Ground Zero cancer legacy&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;For Zagami, who’ll be allowed to continue the clinical trial for two more years despite the fact that the drug has now been approved for MZL, his cancer has taken on an even deeper meaning. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The thick dust that covered Zagami and tens of thousands of others who worked at Ground Zero in the days after 9/11 held a mixture of toxins and irritants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These include asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), benzene, dioxin, glass fibers, gypsum, cement particles, heavy metals such as lead, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In January 2011, less than a year after Zagami was diagnosed with lymphoma, President Barack Obama signed into law the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Zadroga Act created the World Trade Center Health Program, which covers medical expenses for a list of more than 90 conditions linked to exposure at Ground Zero, including multiple types of lymphoma and leukemia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As of June 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WTC Health Program reported an enrollment of more than 5,400 people who have been diagnosed with cancers linked to the 9/11 attacks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While his cancer was probably caused by the exposure, Zagami didn’t initially file a claim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, he’s been private about his cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I didn’t tell anyone anything, I kept it a secret,” said Zagami, who has two children and two grandchildren. “Only my wife and kids knew, but the rest of my family didn’t. Both of my parents are still alive and they’re elderly. I didn’t want them to worry about me. I was doing well. But now they know.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zagami said he finally decided recently to file a claim with the WTC Health Program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some people I worked with got sick. I didn’t want to, but people told me to do it, so I filed a claim,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Zagami added that if he could go back in time and was given the option of not volunteering at Ground Zero, he would still do it again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Treating other cancers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people with a number of different cancers have benefitted from ibrutinib.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Its approval last week for MZL is just the latest breakthrough for this drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to MZL, ibrutinib has also been approved to treat people with:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), including people with 17p deletion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) in people who have received at least one prior therapy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), another type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Janssen, which has the rights to the drug outside the United States, is also expanding its use in Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Janssen announced last May that the European Commission (EC) approved the drug for all patients with CLL, expanding the number of people who may benefit from this treatment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Janssen also expects to introduce the drug to people with lymphoma sometime later this year in &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/campaign-launches-to-battle-cancer-crisis-in-china-012516&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, where lymphoma is on the rise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marginal zone lymphoma is China’s second most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, following diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), multiple cancer researchers and industry observers in China told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is currently no standard treatment in China for these people. But sources tell Healthline that physicians in China took notice of the news that ibrutinib was approved by the FDA for people in the United States with MZL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Janssen has submitted ibrutinib for approval in China and asked that the drug get priority review due to better efficacy than what is currently available. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company is working with the national cancer community in China and patient advocates to inform people with lymphoma about their treatment options. The national cancer community is waiting until the drug is officially approved by China authorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Zagami said the drug was a lifesaver for him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think with ibrutinib, it just made my cancer a manageable disease,” he said. “The same way people take blood pressure medication to make that manageable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
&gt;Maybe you prefer a food truck classic like a Philly cheesesteak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or something a little southern, like brown sugar marinated fried chicken drowning in bacon gravy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever your tastes, you’re sure to find something to thrill your palate at one of the thousands of food trucks across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While you’re reveling in spicy sauces and meaty juices, though, consider the finer details of your on-the-go meal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most foods you’re getting when you go out to eat are not going to have the right balance of nutrients,” Dr. Deborah Cohen, physician scientist at RAND Corporation, told Healthline. “They are going to have too many calories, too much salt, too much sugar, and too much fat.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is as true for food trucks as it is for restaurants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With some exceptions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Matcha Konomi, a food truck in Corpus Christi, Texas, customers line up for healthy favorites like matcha green tea latte and avocado toast.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Owner Michelle Fraedrick started the business when she realized most fast food options around town didn’t match her dietary preferences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Eating healthy and eating ‘real food’ is something I am very passionate about,” Fraedrick told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many public health officials would no doubt love to see a few more Matcha Konomis around the country. But they’d probably settle for food trucks offering one or two healthy meals alongside their best sellers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Which is what Cohen and her colleagues attempted in Los Angeles, where thousands of licensed and unlicensed food trucks — known as “loncheras” — serve up tasty meals to hungry customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The big question is: Would food truck operators bite?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Study encourages healthier meals&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, Cohen’s team found 11 food trucks willing to participate in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These few were “a forward-looking group, a progressive group of loncheras,” said Cohen. “They agreed that the customers they serve need to eat healthier.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Food truck operators worked with nutritionists to create meals that met &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.choosemyplate.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MyPlate&lt;/a&gt; guidelines for recommended amounts of protein, vegetables, and fruit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Study workers helped the food trucks market these meals to customers, using the name “La Comida Perfecta” — the perfect meal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fraedrick thinks there is untapped need for nutritious fast food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;hl-poll&quot; style=&quot;float:right; margin:10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9649285.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://polldaddy.com/poll/9649285/&quot;&gt;How often do you eat at a food truck?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I truly believe people are trying to move away from unhealthy foods — or at least eating them daily — and trying to find healthy alternatives,” she said. “More food trucks should have at least one healthy option on the menu for those looking to stick to their health goals.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Food truck operators also received a small subsidy for participating in the study as well as $2 coupons to encourage customers to buy these healthier meals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although the healthier meals accounted for only 2 percent of the trucks’ overall sales by the end of the study, they were still a hit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When people tried these new dishes, they liked them,” said Cohen. “The majority really liked them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, even with the extra marketing of the healthy meals, customers tended to stick with “the usual.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We found the majority of people were following their habits, and ordering the same thing all the time,” said Cohen. “So if we want people to make changes, sometimes they need to be nudged to try something new.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given the low number of food truck operators who volunteered for the study, this may require cities and towns to motivate food trucks to offer healthier meals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Communities that are concerned about the health of their residents should take steps to make sure that when people go out to eat, they’re not being put at risk of chronic disease,” said Cohen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/div-classtitlecan-latino-food-trucks-loncheras-serve-healthy-meals-a-feasibility-studydiv/4B5B118023A3C0A791B7F731CBC7E102&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was published online this month in the journal Public Health Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Shaping eating habits&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other research shows the potential of using food trucks to steer people toward healthier eating habits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/Pcd/issues/2012/11_0222.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Researchers&lt;/a&gt; in Oakland, Calif., brought a food truck that sells fresh, precut, and bagged fruit — known as a “frutero” — to an elementary school campus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Local regulations sometimes prohibit mobile food vendors — even those offering only healthy foods — from selling near schools and parks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The frutero outside the school — which competed with nearby ice cream and cotton candy vendors — did a brisk business. The truck sold almost 18 bags of fruits and vegetables each afternoon in about half an hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A similar effort in &lt;a href=&quot;http://amarillo.com/news/latest-news/2016-08-31/big-mac-hits-road&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, spearheaded by the Amarillo Independent School District, provides high school students with healthy food truck meals, at the same cost as meals in the school cafeteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other programs use food trucks to bring healthy food to where it’s most needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesherald.com/article/JR/20170103/BUSINESS/170109973&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, food trucks visit local schools with bins filled with growing vegetables that students can try.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One goal of the program, which is sponsored by nonprofit Greener Partners, is to teach children about growing and cooking healthy fruits and vegetables. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wlwt.com/article/truck-loaded-with-fresh-produce-rolls-into-cincinnati-s-food-deserts/3567529 target=&quot;&gt;Cincinnati&lt;/a&gt;, a “grocery store produce section on wheels” visits “food deserts” in the city — areas that lack fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthy whole foods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The program is sponsored by health system TriHealth. Its goal is to feed 250 families each week in 10 neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether food trucks are selling to eager customers or building an oasis of fresh fruit and vegetables in a food desert, there’s potential for them to transform the country’s food environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This matters, because healthy eating is not just about willpower.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If we want people to be healthier, we have to stop wagging our fingers at individuals,” said Cohen, “and look at the environment, look at what people are faced with, and do something about that before we start blaming people.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell us in the comments what your favorite food truck meals are.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/080816_alzheimers_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at a prominent research facility say they have uncovered a new way of attacking Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process, they say, may someday lead to the development of drugs that could prevent, and even reverse, the effects of the deadly brain disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alzinfo.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fisher Center for Alzheimer’s Research Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and was conducted by the organization’s scientists at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockefeller.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Rockefeller University&lt;/a&gt; in New York.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/17/1620963114.abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; were published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists were quick to point out the research is in its early stages, and the development of an effective drug could be years away.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If this is successful, this would be a huge advancement,” Dr. Victor Bustos, senior research associate at the Fisher Center, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;James A. Hendrix, Ph.D., the director of global science initiatives, medical and scientific relations, at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alz.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;, also sees promise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hendrix told Healthline the research was an “interesting look” at a “different way of intervening” in Alzheimer’s disease progression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It introduces a new mechanism for attacking Alzheimer’s,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What researchers found&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fisher Center scientists focused on a mutation that protects older adults from developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers said they discovered that Gleevec, a cancer-fighting drug, and another compound, can mimic the effects of that protective mutation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bustos said researchers did discover that Gleevec did not stay in the brain that long after it entered, so the focus during the studies shifted to the other compound.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, the scientists identified the cellular process responsible for the mutation’s protection effect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All this, the scientists say, can act as a model for effective drugs to battle Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This new finding opens the doors for new treatments that may actually prevent Alzheimer’s disease from developing, which would drastically decrease the number of people affected by the disease,” Paul Greengard, Ph.D., director of the Fisher Center, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bustos said the drugs currently used to treat Alzheimer’s are only able to reduce symptoms and slow the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They don’t really attack the source of the problem,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drugs using this newly discovered process would target the cause of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bustos said the drugs could be given to people when they first start developing signs of Alzheimer’s such as amyloid plaques or tau tangles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The next steps&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bustos said scientists will next test compounds with different types of Alzheimer’s in animals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They will also try to determine any toxicity or side effects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From there, human clinical trials can be conducted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bustos and Hendrix both said there is a long road ahead for this research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hendrix did note that experimental treatments have been successful in curing Alzheimer’s in rats and mice for decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You have to remember that animals aren’t humans,” he said. “Human biology is complicated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted this latest research can advance along with other treatments being studied such as immunotherapies and enzyme inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hendrix said the key will be funding for organizations like the Alzheimer’s Association and the Fisher Center.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need to do good research and do good science,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bustos agreed, noting there is slow, yet steady progress in this field.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What I can say is today we know more than we did yesterday, and today we are closer to a cure than we were yesterday,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Movie ‘Split’ Does Harm to People with Dissociative Identity Disorder, Experts Say
</title>

<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/Split-620.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M. Night Shyamalan is typically praised as a filmmaker who creates unusual stories, but his new movie “Split” has come under fire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the movie, a man with dissociative identity disorder (DID) kidnaps three girls, frightening and harming them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the star, James McAvoy, gives a dramatic performance as the villain, the movie has irked some medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say the film stigmatizes the disorder and may have a negative impact on people who have the condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Howell, a psychotherapist from New York, said the film raises the potential for dangerous attitudes to emerge and for people with the illness to be damaged.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colleagues who have seen the film said it is not an accurate portrayal of someone with DID, she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is a disservice,” Howell said. “This is a common plot device. The serial murderer turns out to have DID. Why not have the plot be about a sociopath like Ted Bundy? Much more plausible.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 1 and 3 percent of people in the world have DID.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The movie may imply that someone with DID could be violent, but experts say those people are more likely to hurt themselves than others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isst-d.org/downloads/Statement%20on%20Split-final.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the movie, the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (ISSTD) cited a soon-to-be-released study of 173 people with DID.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers found that only 3 percent were charged with an offense, 1.8 percent were fined, and less than 1 percent were in jail over a six-month span. No convictions or probations were reported in that time period.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is DID?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;DID used to be referred to as multiple personality disorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is described by the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nami.org/Learn-More/Mental-Health-Conditions/Dissociative-Disorders&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;disorder&lt;/a&gt; that forms when someone is trying to escape reality — often because they experience a traumatic situation such as abuse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, the people with DID shift between separate identities they form inside themselves to escape the trauma.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These personalities may have names, traits, mannerisms, and distinctive voices. When the person switches between personas, they experience memory gaps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People with DID have out-of-body-like experiences. They may feel like voices are trying to control or possess them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And they may also experience anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Peter Barach, a clinical psychologist in Cleveland, told Healthline that most people are not diagnosed with DID right away because most mental health professionals are not trained to recognize the disorder.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most adults with DID have been in the mental health system for several years. They may have received six or seven other diagnoses before DID is accurately identified. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Long-term therapy and medication are used to treat the disorder. Sometimes hospitalization is needed to stabilize a person with DID and ensure their safety. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The psychotherapy helps the person to stabilize their symptoms and improve their ability to function in daily life,” Barach said. “Once the person is stabilized, the treatment works on processing the traumatic memories that interfere with daily functioning, self-esteem, relationships, and personal safety.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A large percentage of people with DID have made potentially lethal attempts to kill themselves,” he added. “The last part of treatment involves helping the ‘alters’ [parts of the self that experience themselves as separate people] to function in a more integrated and consistent way.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Making the movie&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;McAvoy told the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcjxvx9_2F0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Today Show&lt;/a&gt;” that he watched video diaries made by people with DID and inquired about it with medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, he did not sit down with a DID patient while preparing for the role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ISSTD statement criticized those involved in the movie, in particular the filmmaker.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“With respect to Mr. Shyamalan’s ability to write and direct truly frightening movies, depicting individuals with this, or any other mental disorder, does a disservice to his artistic ability and to the over 20 percent of the population who, at some time or another, struggle with some form of mental illness,” the ISSTD statement said. “It acts to further marginalize those who already struggle on a daily basis with the weight of stigma.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Impacts of the film&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Sheldon Itzkowitz, a New York-based psychologist and psychoanalyst, said he had not seen the movie — and doesn’t plan to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What concerns me is how the film may inadvertently demonize people who are truly suffering. DID is a disorder that has its etiology in the worst form of human suffering — the abuse of innocent children,” Itzkowitz told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said many of his patients with DID are highly functioning people whose friends and co-workers don’t know how much the person may be affected by their condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When films and stories “vilify and demonize mental illness in general, and DID in particular,” the viewer does not understand how hard it can be for that person to survive, he added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As such, one of his colleagues views DID as a form of resilience. It is the “mind's effort at trying to cope with overwhelming and terrifying trauma, often at the hands of people who were supposed to care for and protect the child,” Itzkowitz said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barach, who also had not seen the movie when he was interviewed by Healthline, said that the media is fascinated with mental illness as a cause of violence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, nearly all of the media depictions of DID are sensationalized. They sometimes depict treatment that would be considered unethical,” he added. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barach said the movie reviews have led him to believe that the movie will not help society better understand DID. It will only add to the stigma of mental illness in our society. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I wish the media would understand that people with DID suffer greatly and do everything they can to hide or ‘cover’ their symptoms, which they find embarrassing and often disabling,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/070615_sickdoctors_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone gets burned out. Even doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, half of practicing physicians reported feeling burned out, according to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(15)00716-8/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2015 report&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Mayo Clinic Proceedings. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the exact reason Dr. Louise Henson, a family practice physician in Texas, has been working as a locum tenens (temporary doctor) for the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For years, I worked with the underserved in a typical medical setting, putting in long hours and taking my turn on call,” Henson told Healthline. “As a locum, I can pretty much set my schedule and work 40-hour weeks. I do my job when I’m on the job without having to worry about if I’m going to be able to take off time for my family or other personal commitments.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doctors like Henson are in demand. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.staffcare.com/uploadedFiles/2015-survey-temporary-physician-staffing-trends.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; from the locum tenens staffing agency Staff Care reports that the use of temporary physicians is growing, with primary care physicians cited as the most in-demand locum specialty. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, 94 percent of healthcare facility managers surveyed indicated they had used locum tenens doctors sometime over the past 12 months, a 74 percent increase since 2012.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The top reasons facilities hired temporary doctors were to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;fill in until a permanent doctor is found&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;fill in for staff who have left&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;fill in for doctors on vacation or receiving continuing education &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;meet rising patient demand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The practice of medicine requires working more than 40 hours a week, being on call, and working on weekends,” Dr. Janis M. Orlowski, chief healthcare officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), told Healthline. “We see the younger generation of physicians in the beginning of their career looking for a lifestyle change, as well as those at the end of their career who want to work some to stay in the field.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Physician shortage in play&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A shortage of physicians may largely be driving the need for locums. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The AAMC released a &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/doctor-shortage-we-may-need-an-additional-90000-physicians-by-2025-092715&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 that projected a physician shortage ranging between 46,000 and 90,000 over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The shortage is growing, and needs to be addressed,” said Orlowski. “We are asking for support in increasing the number of residency slots we have because of the shortage.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aging patients with increasing healthcare demands and aging physicians who soon will retire are some of the reasons for the shortage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A difficult time filling physician needs in smaller regions of the country also contributes to the shortage, said Dr. Peter Angood, chief executive officer of the American Association for Physician Leadership.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The public should be aware that there are distribution issues within the physician workforce, and there’s data that the shortage is gradually building,” Angood told Healthline. “Therefore the combination of the two will make it such that whatever community you live in you should not be surprised to come across a locum tenens or transient physician for your care.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Should patients be concerned?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Locum tenens are required to have the same licensure and training as other physicians. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These are highly qualified individuals. However, the institutions who hire them need to do the due diligence to make sure they are qualified,” says Orlowski. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She points out that safety procedures can vary between healthcare facilities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s how quickly the doctors can adapt to that and work. Medicine is a team sport so you’re working with nurses and pharmacists, and if the physician is new, care needs to be taken so that communication is clear and that the team works smoothly together under a new physician,” Orlowski says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Angood agrees, noting that doctors who are used to working together get to know and understand each other’s strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you have a more transient workforce coming through there’s a basic level of knowledge of skill, but the institution and doctors that are in the community have to be mindful that the person who’s coming through on a temporary basis may not have the same skill set as what they’re used to,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, this is not unique only to locums, adds Angood. So is the case with medical personnel who work in emergency medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Any time there’s a shift change this happens. The locum tenens is just a different form of a handoff for a period of time,” says Angood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As far as what settings are most suited for locums, Angood points to procedural-based settings that don’t require any type of follow-up since patients who need to follow up with a doctor after a procedure might prefer the same doctor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The same goes for those who see a doctor for a chronic condition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Those practices will do better with a stable physician workforce because the patients rely on connecting with the same group of doctors,” says Angood. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Henson admits that there’s some truth to that notion in her work setting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I may not see you as often as I would if I were in a typical clinical setting. That personal and deep relationship is not going to happen,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, patients’ medical needs will be taken care of, she adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Even if you don’t see me every time, the doctors communicate with each other, and your medical care is priority,” Henson says, noting that having a physician who isn’t burned out has benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think it makes us better physicians when we’re not stressed out, and we’re there because we want to be,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<![CDATA[
p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical science may be about to achieve two things once thought impossible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One is re-growing teeth, something that would eliminate the need for dental fillings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other is healing surgical wounds without leaving scars, a process that involves using a drug designed to treat Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Teams of scientists in England and the United States, following years of research with mice, announced these discoveries this month.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They hope to begin clinical trials soon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No more scars?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine say they have discovered a way to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2017/january/using-fat-to-help-wounds-heal-without-scars&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;manipulate wounds&lt;/a&gt; to heal as regenerated, normal skin rather than as unsightly scar tissue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists transformed the most common type of cells found in wounds into fat cells. This had been considered impossible to accomplish in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research team conducted a large, multiyear study in collaboration with the Plikus Laboratory for Developmental and Regenerative Biology at the University of California, Irvine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They published their &lt;a href=&quot;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/01/04/science.aai8792&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; in early January in the journal Science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We can manipulate wound healing so that it leads to the regeneration of normal skin without scars,” said Dr. George Cotsarelis, who chairs the Department of Dermatology at Penn, and is the Milton Bixler Hartzell Professor of Dermatology, and principal investigator of the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The secret is to regenerate hair follicles first,” he told Healthline. “Then the fat will regenerate in response to the signals from those follicles.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fat cells called adipocytes are normally found in the skin, Cotsarelis said, but they are lost when wounds heal as scars. Myofibroblasts, the most common cells found in healing wounds, were thought to form only scars. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Scar tissue does not have hair follicles associated with it, which gives it an abnormal appearance from the rest of the skin,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cotsarelis and his colleagues used these characteristics as the basis for their work. Their goal was to change the already present myofibroblasts into fat cells, which do not cause scarring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our study showed hair and fat develop separately but not independently,” he said. “Hair follicles form first, and we previously discovered factors necessary for their formation.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While Cotsarelis and his colleagues tried to determine what was sending the signal from the hair to the fat cells, they identified a factor called bone morphogenetic protein, which instructs the myofibroblasts to become fat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This signaling was groundbreaking on its own, he said, as it changed what was previously known about myofibroblasts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now his team has discovered additional factors produced by the regenerating hair follicles that convert the surrounding myofibroblasts to regenerate as fat instead of forming a scar, he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That fat will not form without the new hairs,” he said. “But once it does, the new cells are indistinguishable from the preexisting fat cells, giving the healed wound a natural look instead of leaving a scar.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The potential for applying his research goes beyond preventing scars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cotsarelis said their discoveries also could make it possible to regenerate adipocytes in wrinkled skin, especially in the face, leading to new anti-aging treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cotsarelis is also co-founder of Follica, Inc., a Boston-based company that is developing a system to treat hair loss and to stimulate the growth of new hair follicles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He has filed for a patent and said clinical trials may be eventually conducted at Penn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We looked at isolated molecules from keloids, which are very big benign tumors that form on pierced ears, and are sometimes the size of golf balls,” Cotsarelis said. “If we can convert those cells to fat, it will be easier to treat scarring, including cancer surgery scars.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;No more dental fillings?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In England, scientists at King’s College London have discovered a new method to stimulate the renewal of living stem cells in tooth pulp by using an Alzheimer’s drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nature.com/articles/srep39654&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published this month in Scientific Reports, the researchers detailed their method to stimulate the stem cells inside tooth pulp to generate new dentine — the mineralized material that protects the tooth — in large cavities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This could potentially reduce the need for fillings or cements. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Paul Sharpe, Ph.D., lead author of the ongoing three-year study, specializes in molecular control of tooth development, tissue engineering, and dental stem cells in the college’s Department of Craniofacial Development and Stem Cell Biology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When a tooth suffers trauma or infection, the soft, inner pulp can become exposed and infected,” Sharpe told Healthline. “The body reacts to protect the tooth and produces a thin band of dentine that seals the tooth pulp. This natural process, however, is insufficient to repair large cavities effectively.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dentists use man-made cements or fillings to treat larger cavities and fill holes in teeth, he said. But the cement remains in the tooth and does not disintegrate, so the tooth’s normal mineral level is never completely restored.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharpe and his colleagues found that teeth could use their natural ability to repair large cavities without cements or fillings, which are prone to infections and often need to be replaced a number of times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When fillings fail or infection occurs, dentists have to remove and fill an area that is larger than what is affected, and after multiple treatments the tooth may eventually need to be extracted,” Sharpe said. “As this new method encourages natural tooth repair, it could eliminate all of these issues, and provide a more natural solution for patients.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How did an Alzheimer’s drug, tideglusib, become a candidate for dentine regeneration?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the small molecules the team used to stimulate the renewal of the stem cells included tideglusib, which has been used in clinical trials to treat neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This presents an opportunity to fast track the treatment into practice, Sharpe said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientists used biodegradable collagen sponges to apply low doses of small-molecule glycogen synthase kinase inhibitors to the tooth. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We found that the sponge degraded over time and that new dentine replaced it, leading to complete, natural repair,” Sharpe said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Collagen sponges are commercially available and clinically approved. These factors, he said, add to the potential for this treatment to be adopted quickly and used in dental clinics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharpe plans to seek funding for a clinical trial from the United Kingdom’s Medical Research Council, and will seek commercial partners to move the project forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharpe is optimistic about his discovery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The simplicity of our approach makes it ideal as a clinical dental product for the natural treatment of large cavities, by providing both pulp protection and restoring dentine,” he said. “It brings stem cell biology into clinical dentistry for the very first time, and will hopefully make the clinical dental community aware that biological-based treatments are the future.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

Annual Tobacco Report Highlights Anti-Smoking Measures

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/012517_tobaccoreport_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tobacco industry spends $23 million a day advertising its products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tobacco now kills 480,000 Americans a year, with another 16 million living with diseases caused by tobacco. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those numbers are no surprise to Thomas Carr, director of national policy for the American Lung Association (ALA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nor is the fact that a lot of that industry money pays for advertising to young people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ALA makes keeping children from using tobacco a top priority, but it’s an uphill battle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not just cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tobacco industry is creative in introducing new products like e-cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That is the climate in which the ALA released the results of its 15th annual State of Tobacco Control &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lung.org/our-initiatives/tobacco/reports-resources/sotc/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report evaluates key tobacco control policies at the federal and state levels. Grades are assigned based on how well laws and policies protect residents from death and disease caused by tobacco. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report is not light reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is lengthy and detailed, showing what the federal government, and each state and municipality is doing to eliminate or reduce tobacco use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The report also covers trends, including which communities are doing better and which are falling behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Keeping an eye on legislation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carr keeps an eye on what is happening in the halls of Congress each year as well as the executive branch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A program the association was backing may find more, or less, support depending on who chairs the relevant committee or how the rules of enforcement are written.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the issues closest to his heart is getting the legal age for smoking raised to 21, as was done last year in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-jerry-brown-smoking-bills-20160504-story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen a lot of bills [on this issue] in state legislatures,” Carr told Healthline. “It’s an issue we’ve been pushing.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He explains it as a simple matter of math. If you increase the age to 21, 223,000 premature deaths can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The largest effect can be seen in the number of 15- to 17-year-olds taking up the habit. The reason, according to Carr, is that those teens usually get their cigarettes or other tobacco products from older teens, who would no longer have easy access themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Marketing starts in childhood, he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Cigarettes are as addictive as heroin,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to a higher legal smoking age, Carr would like to see that basic services, such as counseling and workshops on quitting, are available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some health plans offer such coverage. Others don’t.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, Carr said, they don’t know what is going to happen with the change of administrations in Washington.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’re eager for housing rules preventing smoking in all public housing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carr noted that some places have implemented such a policy with voluntary compliance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Evictions are rare,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s an important policy to protect people exposed to secondhand smoke, especially children. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carr said there are 760,000 children in public housing. Smoke seeping through the walls and outlets could make them sick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a more popular policy than you would think,” Carr said. “It’s the number one complaint the lung association gets, about smoke in housing.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Grades and laws&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;California got mixed reviews in the report.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The state was graded as follows: smoke-free air, A; tobacco taxes, B; and access to cessation services, F.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vanessa Marvin, vice president of public policy and advocacy for the ALA in California, emphasized the need for improvement at the local level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Last year a lot was accomplished in the [state] legislature,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;California recaptured some of its national leadership in fighting tobacco use following the successful passage of laws and the approval of Proposition 56 in November. That measure will increase the state’s cigarette tax by $2 per pack as well as increase other tobacco product taxes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2016, California also increased its minimum age of sale for tobacco products to 21 as well as passed a comprehensive quit-smoking benefit for Medicaid recipients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The state also closed loopholes and added e-cigarettes to its smoke-free workplace law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result of Prop. 56, the state will also significantly increase funding for its tobacco prevention and cessation program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While pleased with this progress, Marvin noted that some communities were left behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Big Tobacco gives a lot of money to legislators,” she said. “We have trouble getting bills through the legislature.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year she’s hoping for more action by local leadership. “More than 50 percent of the population doesn’t have protection from tobacco,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The picture is also mixed across the nation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Raising the minimum age of sale for all tobacco products to 21 emerged in 2016 as an effective strategy to keep kids from using tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Hawaii became the first state in the nation to pass that law. Many other states considered &lt;a href=&quot;http://tobacco21.org/state-by-state/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tobacco 21 laws&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. In addition to California, the District of Columbia also passed that law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taxes were another hot issue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The year 2016 marked the return of states using the ballot to increase tobacco taxes. Not since 2006 had there been as many tobacco tax initiatives on the ballot. Only California’s was approved by voters, however.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Funding for state tobacco prevention and cessation, or quit-smoking programs for 2017 generally remained consistent with 2016.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There were notable exceptions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Connecticut provided no new state funding for tobacco prevention and cessation programs for 2017. It joins New Jersey as one of only two states that provide no state funding to combat tobacco use.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tennessee cut funding for tobacco prevention programs by several million dollars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia passed cigarette tax increases through their state legislatures in 2016, but only in Pennsylvania ($1 per pack increase) and West Virginia (65 cents per pack increase) were the increases significant enough to affect smoking rates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Louisiana’s cigarette tax increased by 22 cents per pack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2016, California joined Pennsylvania and West Virginia in establishing new taxes on e-cigarettes or the liquid used in them. Five other states and the District of Columbia already have established taxes on these products.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;California, along with Maine, Missouri, North Dakota, and Ohio, has implemented policies to offer a comprehensive tobacco cessation benefit to all Medicaid enrollees. Missouri became the first state Medicaid program to have no barriers to accessing cessation coverage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, no state has passed a comprehensive statewide smoke-free law, but some progress continued at the local level. California also became the first state to close loopholes in its existing smoke-free law and add e-cigarettes to the law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vermont and the District of Columbia passed legislation in 2016 adding e-cigarettes to their smoke-free laws. Nine states with comprehensive smoke-free laws as well as the District of Columbia now prohibit the use of e-cigarettes in all public places and workplaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/childrens-health/012517_sophiegiraffe_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the second time in about as many years, a product made for young children has been shown to breed mold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sophie the Giraffe, a teething toy designed for children 18 months and under, is the latest item geared toward babies that is under fire by parents who discovered mold inside the toy’s cavity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year, &lt;a href=&quot;/health-news/mold-inside-childs-sippy-cup&quot;&gt;sippy cups&lt;/a&gt; made by Tommee Tippee were in the spotlight when some parents uncovered mold growing in the cup’s valve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The issue of mold involving Sophie the Giraffe was first reported in Good Housekeeping. Pediatric dentist Dana Chianese was washing her child’s toy when she noticed an odd smell coming from the hole at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I decided to cut into Sophie out of curiosity and discovered a science experiment living inside,” Chianese told the magazine. “Smelly, ugly mold living in my infant's favorite chew toy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Pediatricians weigh in&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Healthline turned to pediatricians at two of the country’s top children's hospitals to get their take on the issue of mold growing inside toys.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One was Dr. Sheela Sathyanarayana, M.P.H., environmental health specialist at Seattle Children's Research Institute and an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington’s School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other was Nicholas Newman, D.O., M.S., F.A.A.P., assistant professor of pediatrics and environmental health at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We asked them what makes mold grow on the inside of toys, why the issue continues to pop up, and what parents can and should do about it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news, the pediatricians said, is occasional exposure to mold isn’t as harmful as parents may think.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bad news is some toys and products designed for kids are a perfect breeding ground for the organism to grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mold grows anywhere there is moisture and a carbon source,” Newman said. “It doesn’t surprise me that it would grow inside a kid’s toy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sathyanarayana said this isn’t the first time mold has been known to grow inside a toy, and it likely won’t be the last.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is not new,” she said. “There are probably other toys that have the same problem, but we just don’t know about them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As with Tommee Tippee sippy cups, parents who discovered mold inside Sophie the Giraffe have turned to social media to express their dismay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good Housekeeping said other parents have posted concerns about the toy on Amazon and other websites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sophie the Giraffe has been around for decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The toy, made from natural rubber and decorated with plant-based paint, is manufactured by the French company Vulli.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for the company told Good Housekeeping in a statement that the package instructions state that Sophie the Giraffe should only be cleaned on the surface with a damp cloth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It should not be immersed in the water nor rinsed off, to prevent water from getting inside, as she may become damaged,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Mold is a natural thing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mold, while unpleasant to look at and smell, is everywhere, according to Newman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any attempt to fully eradicate it from our children’s toys, let alone our lives, is futile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mold is how nature tries to recycle everything,” he said. “It’s the normal recycling process.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, mold thrives in damp environments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children’s toys, particularly those that are hollow and have the capacity for moisture to collect on the inside through tiny vents or holes, set up the perfect conditions for mold to grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, most people don’t become sick if they accidentally ingest mold, Newman said. Although people with comprised immune systems such as people with cancer or HIV may show signs of gastrointestinal issues once they consume mold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bigger concern, when it comes to children and mold, is not ingestion but inhalation, said Sathyanarayana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Mold reacts with cells in the lungs and can lead to issues,” she said. “Runny nose, cough, things like that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sathyanarayana noted that a “child that has asthma, allergies, or eczema,” may have some risks if mold is inhaled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Those are the kids most likely to be affected,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Preventative measures&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The best defense against the development of mold inside your child’s favorite toy is to follow use and cleaning instructions, Sathyanarayana noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Really pay attention to instructions,” she said. “Use [toys] only as indicated.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sathyanarayana suspects that some parents are bringing the toy into the tub.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Newman said even if that isn’t the case, cleaning the product with soap and water sets up the right chemistry for mold to grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Soap is a carbon source,” he said. “The mold sees that and goes, ‘Oh good, yum.’”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sathyanarayana noted that if parents do discover mold inside any of their child’s toys, they should make an effort to clear it out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you see mold, a little bleach and water can help remove some of it,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nikki Fleming, spokesperson from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cpsc.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Consumer Product Safety Commission&lt;/a&gt; said parents are welcome to report safety concerns about any toys at saferproducts.gov, or call the toll free hotline at &lt;a href=&quot;file://localhost/tel/(800)%2520638-2772&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;800-638-2772&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We want to hear from consumers,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vulli has not made any further announcements regarding its toy. Tommee Tippee voluntarily recalled six of its cups on January 10 because of the faulty valve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While moldy toys are of great concern for parents, Sathyanarayana said people should be just as vigilant when looking for mold in their homes or offices. Particularly if you live in damp cities, such as Seattle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’d actually be more concerned about proper ventilation in homes — bathrooms and basements,” she said, “than Sophie the Giraffe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

gainst abortion rights and would like to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He’s against human embryonic stem cell research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He doesn’t think tobacco should be regulated as a drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He has voted against the expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But he did support a bill that would have limited monetary damages in malpractice lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those are some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontheissues.org/GA/Tom_Price.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;positions&lt;/a&gt; taken by Dr. Tom Price, the Republican congressman from Georgia who President Donald Trump has nominated to be secretary of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hhs.gov/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Health and Human Services Department (HHS)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At confirmation hearings last week, Price was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/tom-price-hhs-confirmation-hearing-233755&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;questioned&lt;/a&gt; by members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee about some of those views, as well as his support for President Trump’s plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also last week a &lt;a href=&quot;http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/letterPriceNominationfinal.ECBT.01.17.17.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, signed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and dozens of other health-related groups, was sent to key senators asking that they get Price on the record about whether he supports mandatory vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, there’s the question of some of Price’s stock purchases in recent years. Those activities have led some Democratic leaders to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/schumer-calls-ethics-probe-trump-s-hhs-nominee-n703511&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;call for a delay&lt;/a&gt; in Price’s confirmation proceedings while these deals are investigated to see if any ethics rules were broken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The process, however, is still pressing forward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Senate Finance Committee went ahead with its confirmation hearing today for Price, an orthopedic surgeon whose father and grandfather were also doctors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the hearing, Price once again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/us/politics/trump-cabinet-hearing-confirmation.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defended his stock dealings&lt;/a&gt; and answered new questions about some of his tax deductions in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Those who support Price&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Officials in the Trump administration did not respond to several requests from Healthline for an interview on Price’s positions on issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The congressman also has a number of supporters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Medical Association (AMA) is one of more than a half-dozen physician groups that have endorsed Price’s nomination.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href=&quot;https://wire.ama-assn.org/ama-news/why-we-support-dr-price-lead-hhs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;opinion column&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Patrice A. Harris, the AMA’s board chairwoman, said Price understands the challenges facing patients and is willing to listen directly to concerns expressed by the AMA and other organizations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She did point out her group doesn’t agree with Price on all issues. That includes his support for dismantling the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the AMA feels Price’s background is a major plus for the HHS secretary position.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“[His] physician background will provide important perspective within the president’s cabinet,” wrote Harris. “Too often, health policy makers and regulators give short shrift to the real-world impact their plans and decisions can have on how patient care is delivered.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a column on &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/healthcare/314495-hhs-needs-a-doctor-like-tom-price-as-secretary&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Hill website&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. J. Phillip Gingrey, a former Republican congressman from Georgia, called Price “the doctor HHS needs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He is a compassionate, competent, and smart man who will help steer the nation's largest healthcare agency through a period of change with a steady hand on the rudder,” wrote Gingrey.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When he nominated Price in late November, Trump heaped praised on his choice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;[Dr.] Price, a renowned physician, has earned a reputation for being a tireless problem solver and the go-to expert on healthcare policy, making him the ideal choice to serve in this capacity,” Trump said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Abortion rights&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Democrats haven’t challenged Price’s medical knowledge or leadership skills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They do, however, have concerns over some of the six-term congressman’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/18/health/tom-price-hhs-on-the-issues-profile-aca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;political views&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The biggest might be on abortion rights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, Price voted against federal health coverage that included abortion services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2010 and 2011, he voted to prohibit funding for abortion services and organizations like Planned Parenthood.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2007, he voted in favor of granting the “preborn” equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And in 2005 and 2007, he voted against programs for human embryonic stem cell research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontheissues.org/GA/Tom_Price_Abortion.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anti-abortion stance&lt;/a&gt;, Price has been given a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontheissues.org/GA/Tom_Price_Abortion.htm#06n-NRLC&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;100 percent grade&lt;/a&gt; by the National Right to Life Committee.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ross Baker, Ph.D., a political science professor at Rutgers University, said Price would be able to lobby congressional representatives as HHS secretary on abortion issues, but “his hands are tied” on taking action within his department because of the 1973 &lt;a href=&quot;http://landmarkcases.org/en/landmark/cases/roe_v_wade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/a&gt; decision that legalized the procedure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baker said Price would face the same situation with Planned Parenthood funding, although he could encourage states to pass new laws.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Obamacare, tobacco, drugs&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Price has been a consistent, ardent foe of the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He voted against the landmark legislation in 2010 and in favor of the various repeal efforts in the following years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also supported a move to defund the ACA in 2010.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2015, he introduced the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tomprice.house.gov/HR2300&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Empowering Patients First Act&lt;/a&gt; as a “patient-centered” solution to the ACA.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That bill did not become law, but it might be used as a guidepost for Republican proposals this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baker said Price is a “man with a plan” when it comes to new healthcare laws. It’s also one of the congressman’s passions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He really wants to get the federal government out of the [healthcare] business entirely,” Baker told Healthline. “It’s a calling for him.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2007, Price voted against legalization that requires negotiated prescription drug prices for Medicare Part D.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2006, he voted in favor of a law that would deny nonemergency treatment to people who couldn’t afford the copayment under Medicare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the past, he has voted in favor of proposals to limit malpractice awards in lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2009, Price voted against a bill to regulate tobacco as a drug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, as a congressman, Price, reportedly a cigar smoker, tried to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/17/tom-price-questions/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exempt the cigar industry&lt;/a&gt; from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations that require premium, hand-rolled cigars to comply with the same testing and labeling that smokeless tobacco products follow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As HHS secretary, Price would oversee the FDA, but Baker says the new HHS secretary probably won’t push too hard on the tobacco rules.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said Price’s time will be taken up by the ACA replacement plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“He’s going to have to pick his targets,” Baker said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The questions over stock purchases&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Price has faced some fire during his confirmation hearings on a total of $300,000 worth of health-related stock he has purchased the past four years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Democrats say some of those &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/18/why-one-expert-says-tom-prices-stock-deals-may-very-well-have-broken-the-law/?utm_term=.b4969e64ddd7&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;purchases and sales&lt;/a&gt; came while Price was dealing with healthcare legislation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most scrutinized purchases was a so-called “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/trump-s-hhs-nominee-got-sweetheart-drug-stock-deal-n706576&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sweetheart deal&lt;/a&gt;” offered to Price and another congressional representative as well as other U.S. investors last year by the small Australian biotech firm Innate Immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another deal that is under the microscope involved shares Price purchased last spring from Zimmer Biomet, a medical device manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/16/politics/tom-price-bill-aiding-company/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report on CNN&lt;/a&gt; last week stated that Price invested in the company, then introduced legislation to help it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Price has said his broker purchases stock without his prior knowledge, although he does approve the sales on a quarterly and annual basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Price hasn’t answered the question of why he didn’t tell his broker to avoid any health-related stocks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Price denies any wrongdoing and has stated he will divest himself from 43 companies he has an interest in 90 days after he is confirmed as HHS secretary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Democrats’ charges of improper behavior produced a flurry of statements last week from Trump administration officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In those emails sent to Healthline and other news organization, Trump officials asked CNN to retract its Zimmer Biomet story, which they called “junk reporting.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also sent out a release detailing stock holdings from some of the Democrats who criticized Price.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baker said “it would have been prudent” for Price to advise his broker to avoid health-related stocks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He added that Price and other Trump nominees are facing new scrutiny because of the 2012 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/senate-bill/2038&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;STOCK Act&lt;/a&gt;, which cracks down on the financial dealings involving members of Congress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It gives more ammunition for the interrogations,” Baker said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Baker expects Price to be confirmed as the HHS secretary. He said it’s “very rare” for a president’s cabinet choices to be denied.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, that might not dissuade Democrats from some political theater at Price’s hearings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Democrats are out for blood,” said Baker. “They know they’re not going to win, but they want to cut him up a bit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And the financial impact on the country will be astronomical, experts warn.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All the Medicare, Medicaid, and healthcare costs are going to devastate us financially, and we’re just not going to be able to handle it,” Rudolph Tanzi, Ph.D., a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alz.org/facts/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/a&gt;, in 2016 the country spent $236 billion caring for people with Alzheimer’s and other types of dementia. Over two-thirds of these costs were borne by Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Total healthcare spending in the United States for this incurable disease is projected to jump to $1 trillion per year by mid-century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some fear that, unless the government greatly increases Alzheimer’s research funding — and quickly — the disease will overwhelm the healthcare system much sooner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you start trying to calculate when we’re going to hit that tipping point where Medicare and Medicaid are going to be overtaken by Alzheimer’s, it’s not so far away,” said Tanzi. “It could be within five to 10 years, depending upon how many of these baby boomers start showing symptoms.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even if a treatment is found soon, people who have already started down the path of this progressive brain disorder may not benefit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For people who are in their 70s or 80s now, and on their way to Alzheimer’s, even if [scientists] came up with a treatment tomorrow, it’s probably not going to really help those people. It’s a little bit too late for them,” Elizabeth Arledge, award-winning director of the new documentary “Alzheimer’s: Every Minute Counts,” told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These patients will need intensive, and expensive, care for years to come — adding to the impact on Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/tpt/alzheimers-every-minute-counts/home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;PBS documentary&lt;/a&gt; will air at 10 p.m. (ET) on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Burden on healthcare system&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like Arledge’s 2004 film about Alzheimer’s, “The Forgetting: A Portrait of Alzheimer's,” her new film, for which she also wrote and serves as producer, weaves together expert commentary with personal stories from around the country — but with a different focus and a bigger sense of urgency.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We tell these stories through the experiences of families and through individuals,” said Arledge, “but we wanted to focus a little less on that and a little more on the public policy disaster that is looming if we don’t change the trajectory of the epidemic.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right now, that trajectory looks like a public health “tidal wave” about to hit the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By mid-century there could be as many as 16 million people living with this disease in the United States,” Matthew Baumgart, senior director of public policy for the Alzheimer's Association, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are just the people with visible symptoms of the disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you start to calculate how many have Alzheimer’s pathology on their way to symptoms,” said Tanzi, “Ten or 15 years from now, the number [of people affected] probably goes up to at least 25 or 30 million.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The length of time people live with Alzheimer’s, and the intensity of the care needed later on, makes this one of the costliest diseases in the country — and one that could bankrupt Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More research funding needed&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say the key to getting a handle on the Alzheimer’s epidemic is to find new ways to treat and prevent it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Addressing the future solvency of Medicare and Medicaid is going to require addressing Alzheimer’s disease,” said Baumgart. “That’s why research is so important because we can actually save Medicare and Medicaid money by investing in research today.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Government funding for Alzheimer’s disease research, though, has lagged far behind what is spent on other diseases, although there have been signs of progress in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The government has largely been asleep at the wheel about this,” said Tanzi. “They’re starting to wake up, you know. They raised our paltry half a billion dollars of funding up to about a billion now.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In comparison, in 2017 the &lt;a href=&quot;https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NIH allocated&lt;/a&gt; $6 billion for cancer research and $3 billion for HIV and AIDS.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tanzi, though, estimates that heading off the Alzheimer’s epidemic would require much more — along the lines of $10 billion in research funding.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some might balk at that kind of up-front investment, but this approach has helped with other diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Government — whatever people think about it — has actually worked in the area of medical research,” said Baumgart. “Because of the research funding that has been given over the years to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and HIV and AIDS, you see demonstrable progress. Deaths from those diseases have dropped in the last 15 years — and in some cases, dropped significantly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tanzi also says that tackling Alzheimer’s will mean stopping it earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This has worked for heart disease, where doctors screen people early for risk factors — like high cholesterol — and treat those before someone has a heart attack or congestive heart failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s also worked with early screening and treatment of cancer — rather than waiting for a person to develop a large tumor or organ failure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If you want to stop this disease — eradicate this disease — you have to take the same approach we take in cancer and heart disease,” said Tanzi. “Which is detect early on that the pathology has begun and then stave it off so you never get symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<title>Are We Headed Toward a World Without Antibiotics?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/012417_antibiotics_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would a world without antibiotics be like?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s what David Weiss, Ph.D., director of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.antibiotics.emory.edu/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Emory Antibiotic Resistance Center&lt;/a&gt;, thinks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A world without effective antibiotics would be terrible, an 80-year trip backward in time,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Weiss notes that many great achievements of modern medicine would be reversed if antibiotics ceased to exist.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Transplants would no longer be possible, many cancer treatments would be too dangerous, and very premature babies would have greatly reduced survival rates,” Weiss said. “Routine surgeries would carry great risk. Even seemingly harmless cuts and scrapes could prove deadly. The way we go through life would be fundamentally changed.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Although Weiss notes a world without antibiotics is far from a certainty, and perhaps not even likely, he also suggests that for patients with drug resistant infections, his hypothetical scenario has already become a reality. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That was the case for a woman in Reno, Nev., who died last year from an incurable infection that was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/woman-killed-by-a-superbug-resistant-to-every-available-antibiotic/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resistant to all 26 antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; available in the United States. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She had spent a significant amount of time in India, and had contracted a bone infection after breaking her right femur (thigh bone). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When she was hospitalized in Reno last August doctors found she was infected with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CRE are a class of bacteria that are resistant to a number of antibiotics, including carbapenems, drugs that are considered the last resort when all other antibiotics have failed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has described CREs as “nightmare bacteria” due to their ability to spread their resistance to other bacteria. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Typically, CRE spreads in hospitals and care facilities. It causes an estimated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;9,300 infections&lt;/a&gt; and 610 deaths in the United States each year. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Spreading more than anticipated&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/01/10/1616248114.full?sid=51df8b41-148a-42aa-99e8-ec642e8b5224&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published this month from researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, found that CRE may be spreading more widely than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may also be passing between people asymptomatically, meaning it does so without showing any obvious symptoms. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need to look harder for this unobserved transmission within our communities and healthcare facilities if we want to stamp it out,” William Hanage, Ph.D., associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H Chan School, and senior author of the study, said in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/drug-resistant-nightmare-bacteria-diversify-spread/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee Riley, head of the infectious diseases department at the University of California, Berkeley, says antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to public health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People should recognize that antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are an epidemic of worldwide proportions, and they kill more people each year than Ebola or Zika virus, which gain more attention in the lay media. This silent epidemic needs to be better recognized,” he told Healthline. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, every year at least 2 million people in the United States become infected with bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. Of those at least 23,000 die as a result of these infections. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Many factors led us to this point,” Weiss said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Pharmaceutical companies stopped developing new antibiotics in part because they have not been as profitable as other drugs. The use of antibiotics for growth promotion in farming [nonmedical uses] is another factor. Complacency in thinking that things wouldn't get this bad was a big factor as well,” Weiss added.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Riley also emphasizes the need for reducing use of antibiotics in farming, arguing if nothing is done to address this it may be too late to fix. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“At this time, there is very little emphasis on addressing the problem of antibiotic use as a growth promoter in animal husbandry … More than 70 percent of all antimicrobial agents manufactured are used in animal husbandry. This is a huge source of drug-resistant pathogens and needs to be recognized,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What can be done&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developing new antibiotics and diagnostic tests, using antibiotics more sparingly, and reducing their use in agriculture are some of the ways experts suggest antibiotic resistance could be combatted, but it will require a significant global investment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, Weiss says there are ways the general public can do their part to help stop the increase in antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Urge your lawmakers to support increased funding for research and regulations that limit the overuse of antibiotics. Purchase antibiotic-free products [soap, meats, etc.] to incentivize producers to stop using unnecessary antibiotics. If you or your loved ones are in the hospitals, insist that care providers wash their hands each time they enter the room,” he said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Weiss says, both the medical community and the general public should avoid becoming complacent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“As we would, bacteria will always try to survive,” he said. “They evolve rapidly, and are under great pressure to find ways to resist antibiotics. They have had decades to become as resistant as they are today. We should not think that if we simply develop new drugs, we will be past this problem. We will also have to remain vigilant and not let our guard down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Obamacare Being Dismantled: Now What?</title>

<description>
<![CDATA[
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/012017_obamacarerepeal_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Affordable Care Act’s days are numbered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congress has already started efforts to repeal the 2010 legislation and come up with an alternative. On Monday, two Republican senators &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/collins-cassidy-obamacare-repeal/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;introduced a proposal&lt;/a&gt; they called an “Obamacare replacement plan.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Sunday, one of President Trump’s advisors said the administration &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/01/22/510984148/republican-plan-to-replace-obamacare-would-turn-medicaid-over-to-states&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;plans to turn control&lt;/a&gt; of the federal Medicaid program to the states.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This all followed President Donald Trump’s signing of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/inauguration-2017/trump-signs-executive-action-obamacare-inauguration-day-n710116&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, directing federal agencies to “minimize the economic burden” of the Obamacare health law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what will happen when the dust clears?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts say it depends on what Congress and the president come up with as a replacement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The predictions range from chaos as tens of millions of people lose their insurance coverage, to an efficient, affordable healthcare system that’s overseen at the state level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dire predictions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52371&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that stated what their analysts believe could happen in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the study, the CBO researchers went on the assumption the Affordable Care Act (ACA) would be completely repealed and replaced with something similar to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3762&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;H.R.3762&lt;/a&gt;, a Republican-sponsored bill that was approved by Congress in 2015 but vetoed by then-President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CBO report predicts that 18 million people would lose insurance coverage. Of that group, they said 10 million would be people who bought insurance though the ACA marketplace. Another 5 million would be Medicaid recipients, and the final 3 million would be people who would lose employer-based insurance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The analysts added that once government and Medicaid subsidies were eliminated, 27 million would become uninsured.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They predicted that 32 million people who now have insurance would lose their coverage by 2026.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CBO report also predicted insurance premiums would rise initially by 25 percent for policies purchased by individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That would increase to a 50 percent hike once subsidies are eliminated and a 100 percent jump by 2026.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also forecast that half of the U.S. population will live in areas without a marketplace insurance setup. That will increase to 75 percent by 2026.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many Democratic leaders have made similar predictions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Monday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) released a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democraticleader.gov/newsroom/12317/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, saying the Republican actions will take seniors and working families “from affordable care to chaos.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others aren’t as sure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kurt Mosley, vice president of strategic alliances for Merritt Hawkins healthcare consultants, said the CBO is less bipartisan than it used to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted the agency made some rosy predictions about the success of Obamacare that didn’t quite come true.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Lately, they’ve been more wrong than right,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What to look for&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts like Mosley said there are several key components that will determine whether the nation’s healthcare system succeeds or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first is the ACA provision of requiring insurance companies to provide coverage for people with preexisting medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Trump and other Republicans leaders have said they want to keep that requirement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That may end up creating &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/president-donald-trump-health-insurance-high-risk-pool.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fh&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;high-risk pools&lt;/a&gt; where people with preexisting conditions can get insurance, but at higher costs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the ACA’s mandate that people must have insurance coverage or face financial penalties appears to be headed for the scrap heap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some experts say that provision could actually be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/five-obamacare-provisions-trump-could-change-right-away-n709771&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;done away with&lt;/a&gt; under the executive order President Trump signed on Friday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s also the “employer mandate” that requires companies to provide certain minimum healthcare coverage. That also seems unlikely to survive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mosley added it will be important for new healthcare laws to retain the provision that allows young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 to stay on their parents’ healthcare plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted that without the individual mandate it will be important to have incentives for younger, healthier people to buy insurance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He also thinks it’s crucial that insurance companies be allowed to sell policies across state lines, something they can’t do in ACA marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We need to get insurance companies to play ball,” Mosley said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What may eventually happen is what happened last year in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-23/why-kentucky-couldn-t-kill-obamacare-a-lesson-for-congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That state elected a governor who promised to get rid of Obamacare. When it was all said and done, Kentucky crafted a healthcare program with a new name that had most of the provisions of the ACA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Women Need to Get Heart Checkups in Their 20s, Experts Say
</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/womens-health/012017_girlsheart_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s the general advice given by medical professionals to women for having their heart health checked.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Plaque buildup in the arteries and other problems that lead to heart disease can begin manifesting when people are in their teens and early 20s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, most women in the United States don’t think they should begin getting heart screenings until much later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A national online survey commissioned by Orlando Health polled 2,054 U.S. adults, including 1,062 women. A majority of women — 60 percent — believe that heart screenings aren’t recommended until people are in their 30s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just 8 percent of women thought heart screenings should start in their 20s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On average, women think a seemingly healthy person should begin getting heart screenings at the age of 41.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A cardiologist who spoke to Healthline said awareness of heart disease has come a long way, but there are still significant gaps in education and perception.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Not just a problem for men&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular diseases are the number one cause of death worldwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They’re the number one killer of women in the United States.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Maria Carolina Demori, a cardiologist who leads the Women’s Cardiac Center at Orlando Health Heart Institute, says women traditionally haven’t been aware of the risks of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We used to think that heart disease was more of a men’s problem,” she told Healthline. “However, women were dying of heart disease more than men for many years — for decades. Now, women are dying less of heart disease than men, but it’s still the number one killer of women. There’s a significant lack of awareness of heart disease in women, and only about 50 percent of women know that the number one killer of women is heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Demori says that men are more likely than women to recognize heart attack symptoms such as chest pains and shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s better now, but in the past, doctors would often diagnose these symptoms in women as anxiety or indigestion, rather than something more serious,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One fact for sure is that many cardiovascular trials, in the past, were for men. For some reason, more men got enrolled in these trials than women,” says Demori. “Women, I think, sometimes seek medical care less often because they’re busy. This is harmful because we know that women do poorly when they have a heart attack. They’re more likely than men to die after experiencing a heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another possible reason for the perception of cardiovascular disease as a problem for men is the different physiology between the sexes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Women sometimes don’t have the significant obstructions in the coronary artery that would lead to a positive stress test,” says Demori. “In men, there are more obstructions, so a stress test is more likely to turn up positive. Now, we have better techniques, so it’s easier to determine when arteries are not dilating and working properly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Demori says there’s reason for optimism as awareness increases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think now, women are more aware of the symptoms of heart disease and, therefore, they’re now looking for help, while in the past they may not have,” she said. “Many of the risk factors for heart disease were tailored more toward men than women in the past, while now they’re tailored for women as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Early education crucial&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite advancements in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, the survey indicates that most women don’t think screening is necessary for an otherwise healthy person until later in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/Heart-Health-Screenings_UCM_428687_Article.jsp#.WIOH5bYrK1u&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; men and women begin regular checkups for blood pressure, cholesterol, and body mass index when they’re 20.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Demori agrees, saying people should begin seeing their doctor for heart screenings right after their teen years, pointing out that undiagnosed heart problems only get worse with time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think education at a very early age is important,” she says. “I don’t think we should wait until people are in their 20s, 30s, or 40s to educate people. Education can start very early, at school. We can teach kids that they can prevent and reduce their risk of heart disease by helping them understand that they can start developing that plaque in their arteries as early as their teen years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It is something that can progress and get really bad, depending on risk factors,” Demori added. “So I think educating kids at a young age, telling them that this is something they can prevent, would be a big step in the right direction.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scratchy throat. The achy joints. The stuffy nose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s hard to ignore the symptoms of cold and flu — but that doesn’t stop us from trying. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We show up to work and nurse a headache all day. We cough until, at last, we’re begged by our coworkers to take our germs home already.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether sick workers show up because there’s a crucial meeting, they fear being punished, replaced, or fired, or because they’re hourly workers who need the money, they do real harm by spreading their illnesses to everyone else in their vicinity. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Lee Norman, the chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Hospital, acknowledges that people “want to demonstrate to their bosses and coworkers that they have a strong work ethic, so a lot of them suck it up and go to work.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It might be a noble idea,” Norman told Healthline, but “it doesn’t work well for containing the spread of diseases.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, Norman says, there may be no place worse than an office environment for containing germs. There’s little air circulation and, in most cases, outside windows can’t be opened.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“People are in close proximity, and it’s just kind of a perfect setup for the spread of disease,” he says. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What’s so bad about offices?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norman says that this time of year is ripe for respiratory viruses like cold and flu, which are spread primarily via coughing and sneezing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even if a sneeze from Mary in Accounting doesn’t land right in your face, “it’ll settle down on to a surface and be contagious from that perspective. Viruses live on the surface of things for a long time, and it’s easy to pick something up,” says Norman. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anything people are touching presents the greatest danger of virus transfer, Norman says, but in office settings it seems the number of such items is a lot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Copy machines, door handles, keyboards, phones, light switches, elevator buttons, vending machines, microwaves, and conference room tables are all breeding grounds for germs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Says Norman, “Hands are the things that carry from one person to the next. People mop up their runny nose, then don’t wash their hands. Then they take the half-and-half out of the refrigerator,” and the next thing you know, half the office has been felled by the same lingering cough. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A poll of Healthline readers showed people are split over whether to come to work when they're sick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the online survey of 119 people done last week, about a third said they always come to work sick.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Almost half said they sometimes come in, while slightly more than 20 percent said they never come in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;’Tis the season&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;January through March are typically the prime months for cold and flu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s because the cold weather forces people indoors, and the period following the holiday season is notorious for creating illness in children (and, in turn, the parents of those children).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year’s strain of flu is set to be a doozy, according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/flu-season-getting-worse-cdc-says-n704061&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&lt;/a&gt;. Ten states — in particular, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/01/06/flu-cases-hit-us-coastal-cities-hard-particularly-nyc/96249856/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;those on both coasts&lt;/a&gt; — have already seen spikes, and the CDC predicts it will only get worse. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The observations and data collected so far this year by Lisa-Marie Gustafson, a human resources manager at aerospace company Hexcel, certainly backs the claim that this time of year is ripe for employee illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We are definitely seeing that our delivery is well below where it should be,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speaking on behalf of the Society of Human Resource Management, Gustafson says, “It’s not just loss of employees’ time, it absolutely is loss of real dollars.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gustafson says that in order to stem the tide of sick workers, she’s had to have “some hard conversations” with employees who insist on coming to work while ill, because those who haven’t stayed home have affected those around them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Especially those who work in close team environments, it’s more than just one person that’s going out on illness,” she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Remote possibility&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many employers, Hexcel offers working from home as an option for office-based employees who are feeling unwell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Technology like email, video conferencing, and messaging apps have expanded the ability of workers to keep their germs at home. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what about those in the manufacturing and retail sectors? Most part-time and hourly employees don’t have the option of working from home when they’re not feeling well, because not showing up means not making money. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Current U.S. law does not require employers to provide paid sick days. In fact, the law does not even protect workers from being fired when they miss work due to health reasons, as viral star &lt;a href=&quot;http://people.com/human-interest/new-hampshire-man-fired-for-attending-sons-birth/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lamar Austin&lt;/a&gt; proved earlier this month. He was sacked for choosing to stay with his wife — instead of working at his security guard job — while she gave birth to their fourth child. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Obama proposed a law in 2015 that called for mandating seven days of paid sick time a year for all workers, but Congress declined to pursue the legislation. However, 23 cities and states have passed laws requiring paid sick time for part-time workers, according to the nonprofit organization &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.workplacefairness.org/paid-sick-leave&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Workplace Fairness&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;San Francisco passed a paid sick leave law in 2007. Since then, Portland, Ore.; Seattle; Washington; New York, and the state of Connecticut, among others, have followed suit. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Businesses have argued that these types of laws could lead to price hikes or negatively impact their overall hiring, but the New York law was studied last year by the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR), which found it to be a “nonevent.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors of the report, economist Eileen Appelbaum, Ph.D., and sociologist Ruth Milkman, Ph.D., reported that the law had little business impact, saying, “The vast majority of employers were able to adjust quite easily,” and “85 percent reported that the new law had no effect on their overall business costs.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staying home (or, if possible, working from home) while under the weather benefits not only workers’ health, the health of their fellow employees, and the overall productivity of employers, it also benefits all the people with whom the sick worker would be interacting. That includes customers, clients, and the already immune deficient.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s a whole frail segment of the population: older people, babies, people with immune deficiencies or underlying chronic illnesses, people with acute leukemia, people who are going through or just coming off of chemotherapy,” said Norman. “What might be a minor illness to you and me can be a life-threatening illness to somebody like that.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sucking it up&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Norman, “A cornerstone of public health is to voluntarily sequester oneself away so as to protect those around them.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a blinding flash of the obvious,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So why do people persist in coming into work when they’re ill?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/studies-articles/surveys/workplace-flu-survey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from global public health and safety organization NSF reveals that 25 percent of the U.S. workers the group surveyed said their boss expects them to come in no matter what.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The survey also found that 42 percent of workers “have deadlines or are afraid they will have too much work to make up if they take a sick day,” and 37 percent said they can’t afford to take the time off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The survey also showed that men are twice as likely as women to tough it out when they’re not feeling well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, two-thirds of those surveyed by NSF considered sick coworkers to be hard workers, while 16 percent reported they felt their ill colleagues didn’t care about their coworkers’ well-being.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CEPR conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cepr.net/documents/publications/paid-sick-days-2009-05.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of 22 other countries’ sick leave policies and found that in Europe, most workers are guaranteed days off for illness, paid for either by employers (Netherlands, Switzerland, and United Kingdom), the government (France, Ireland, and Italy), or a combination of both (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, and Sweden). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gustafson, whose company has offices throughout Europe, describes that continent’s sick-time policies as “far more robust,” but says about U.S. sick policies, “We’re getting there.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flu shots and common sense&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If human resources departments, and public health advocates can’t convince workers to stay at home or work from home while sick, what are the other options? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One way Gustafson’s company is trying to combat the spread of flu is by offering free flu shots to all employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, she says, “It seems like in those who got the flu shot, we’re not seeing the same amount of illness.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Her company doesn’t mandate flu shots, but the University of Kansas does. It’s a requirement for the hospital’s 10,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s no question that the best way to reduce the burden of influenza is by influenza vaccine, and I’m very much a proponent,” Norman said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No one is truly immune from flu or other viruses, but getting a flu shot can shorten the course of flu as well, says Norman.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, the doctor says that he’s been immunized for 43 years running and has never had the flu. And according to the CDC, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/matte/nivw-vaccination.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it's not too late&lt;/a&gt; to get a flu shot this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The best defense&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to preventive measures like getting a flu shot, the NSF says to take defensive steps such as eating healthily and taking vitamins.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Norman recommends humidifying the air and getting a good night’s rest. He also recommends frequent hand washing or hand sanitizing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If I’ve been exposed to something, I should not assume I don’t have it on me. I should wash my hands,&quot; he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you suspect you're coming down with something but you absolutely must report to work, make sure you’re doing all you can to avoid spreading your germs to others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cough and sneeze into a tissue, or at least into the crook of your arm instead of your hands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wash your hands frequently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don’t go into communal areas, and, if necessary, wear a mask. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for employers who expect their employees to show up no matter what, they’re only hurting themselves in the long run.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your employees are your greatest competitive advantage,” Gustafson says. “If they are ill, or if they feel like, ‘I’m just another person,’ that hurts your bottom line. We want you to stay home and take care of yourself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://shonnavalli-dev.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/general-health/012017_ruralhealth_THUMB.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; image-copyright=&quot;&quot; image-has-syndication-rights=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh air. Wide open spaces. Starry skies above.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rural America has long claimed a reputation as a healthy place to live.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But the truth is that rural areas in the United States generally lag behind urban areas in many aspects of health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/ss/ss6601a1.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; released this month by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) highlights the health situation for those living the country life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Americans living in rural areas face a higher risk of dying from the five leading causes of death in the United States — heart disease, cancer, lower respiratory disease, stroke, and unintentional injuries — compared with their urban counterparts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This report confirms the findings that we’ve seen in previous studies about rural populations tending to be older, poorer, and sicker,” Dr. Daniel Derksen, director of the Arizona Center for Rural Health, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Using mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System, CDC researchers determined that these five leading causes accounted for almost 62 percent of all deaths in the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Between 1999 and 2014, death rates for heart disease and cancer dropped across the country, but both fell more slowly in nonmetropolitan, or rural, areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Urban and rural areas saw similar drops in the death rates for stroke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Death rates for chronic lower respiratory disease — which includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — decreased in urban areas, but increased in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers also estimated the percentages of “potentially excess deaths” by comparing the death rates in counties in states with the lowest rates. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These excesses for heart disease, unintentional injury, and chronic lower respiratory disease were higher in rural areas. They also are potential targets “for public health prevention efforts focused on rural populations,” the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The rural-urban health gap, though, extends beyond disease mortality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not just the increased death rate, which is concerning and unacceptable enough,” said Derksen, “It’s also the collateral damage that these diseases cause.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Accidents and chronic diseases can lead to disability, which makes it harder for people to work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This can snowball, with people not being able to afford doctor visits, lab tests, prescription medications, or even a car to get to their appointments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Lifestyles are a factor&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2014, approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/population-migration/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;15 percent of Americans&lt;/a&gt; — or 46 million people — lived in nonmetropolitan counties, spread across 72 percent of the country’s land area. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overall life expectancy in the United States has increased over the past decades, but more slowly in rural areas. One &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cfah.org/hbns/2014/gap-in-life-expectancy-between-rural-and-urban-residents-is-growing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that the life expectancy gap between urban and rural areas has grown from 0.4 years in 1971 to 2.0 years in 2009.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unhealthy behaviors may be dragging down the life expectancy and health of Americans living in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/rural-health-disparities#mortality-rates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South Carolina Rural Health Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, Americans in rural areas are more likely to smoke, use alcohol or other substances, be physically inactive or overweight, or have poor access to healthy foods. They are also more likely to not wear car seat belts, a factor in motor vehicle deaths.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18257870&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Childhood obesity&lt;/a&gt; is also a particular problem in rural areas, with 25 percent of children overweight in 2008, compared with 19 percent of urban children.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Certain types of substance abuse affect rural areas more than urban ones, as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The opioid epidemic has been getting much attention in the press, and it’s certainly one that’s affecting rural areas more than urban areas, and rural areas have fewer resources to address it,” Carrie Henning-Smith, Ph.D., M.P.H., M.S.W., a research associate at the University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/substance-abuse#drinking&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2012 study&lt;/a&gt; by the Maine Rural Health Research Center concluded that alcohol use and binge drinking were more common among 12- to 13-year-olds in rural areas, compared with youth of the same ages in urban areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/substance-abuse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rural Health Information Hub&lt;/a&gt;, abuse of prescription opioids in the past year was more common in adults in urban areas than those in rural area. But rates of deaths and injuries from misuse of these drugs was higher in states with high rural populations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What’s behind the health gap?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to the unhealthy behaviors identified by the authors of the CDC report, other factors lie behind the rural-urban health gap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A lot of rural health disparities are driven not by one particular health issue, but by differences in the social determinants of health,” said Henning-Smith.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those include unequal access to jobs or education, transportation, social activities, recreational facilities, and even whether there are sidewalks to encourage people to walk more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“All of those things that we think of as going with health and being part of this healthy lifestyle aren’t necessarily embedded into the fabric of rural communities in the way they are in urban communities,” added Henning-Smith.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Economic factors, in particular, drain the health of rural America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/the-affordable-care-act-and-insurance-coverage-in-rural-areas/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured&lt;/a&gt;, rural areas have higher rates of poverty and unemployment as well as lower household incomes compared with urban areas. They also have lower rates of college or university education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/minorityhealth/chdir/2011/factsheets/educationincome.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of death, unhealthy behaviors, poor access to healthcare, and inadequate quality of care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Specific populations in rural areas may face their own unique problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Along the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona, “there are not enough health providers that speak Spanish,” said Derksen. “Being able to communicate effectively in the language which they’re most comfortable with is an important factor” in accessing medical care.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, Derksen added, “some chronic diseases tend to be more prevalent in certain populations,” including higher rates of type 2 diabetes in Hispanic adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Older people in rural areas — because of the larger distance from family and neighbors — are especially at risk of social isolation. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A person might go longer without someone noticing that they’re not doing well,” said Henning-Smith. “So they might go longer without screening or treatment than someone who is in really close contact with people.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then there are the wide open spaces to contend with.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the counties in Arizona are bigger than many New England states. And New England’s population is more than double that of Arizona.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People may have to travel hours to get to the doctor or hospital. Without a car — or services like Uber or Lyft, which are not common in rural areas — this can be daunting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/aib795/30150_aib795_lowres_002.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2005 USDA Information Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;, Americans living in rural areas without cars are more dependent on public transportation. But only 60 percent of rural counties offer any services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s not as though people in urban areas don’t also live in poverty or struggle to afford a car,” said Henning-Smith. “But there’s the infrastructure to get to the doctor if they need to. There are public transportation options — albeit not perfect — but they exist. In a lot of rural communities, they don’t exist at all.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And when older adults are placed in long-term care facilities, they may end up far from home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s really disruptive for someone who’s lived their whole life, or a good portion of their life, in a community,” said Henning-Smith, “to suddenly find themselves somewhere else just to get the care that they need.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Boosting rural health&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of these issues may be easier to address than others.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/ss/ss6602a1.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;related commentary&lt;/a&gt;, CDC authors call for improved public health prevention efforts focused on rural populations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These would target risk factors for the leading causes of death through increased screenings for high blood pressure, cholesterol, and cancer, as well as smoking cessation programs. It would also include educating people about eating better, exercising more, and motor vehicle safety.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Others see a need for a broader approach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“How do we really transform lives and communities, not only within the doctor’s office, but throughout every aspect of their lives?” said Henning-Smith. “We know this impacts health much more than what happens just in the doctor’s office.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the challenge again is the fabric of rural America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These are very large areas, often considered frontier in terms of population density,” said Derksen. “How do you get the information out to those folks who really need it?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Public health and education efforts alone will not reduce rural health disparities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to cities, rural areas suffer from two factors that continue to widen the health gap.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The combination of not enough providers, not enough clinics, not enough hospitals — along with a high rate of uninsured — is a kind of a recipe for health system failure,” said Derksen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These issues can limit people’s access to healthcare — and to the screenings, vaccinations, and treatments that can improve a person’s health or reduce the severity of a disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/topics/rural-health-disparities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rural Health Information Hub&lt;/a&gt;, less than 10 percent of doctors set up practice in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There are often not the number or array of specialty physicians, clinics, and hospitals readily available for people to access primary care, preventive, and specialty services,” said Derksen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rural demographics play a role, too, as seen with a shortage of caregivers for older adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There’s not the same workforce, partly because the population structure is different,” said Henning-Smith “You don’t have the same number, or proportion, of younger folks there to help take care of older folks.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Programs like the National Health Service Corps, which offers loan forgiveness to providers who practice in rural areas, take a financial incentive approach to luring providers to these more remote locations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But sometimes exposing people to the best of rural America is enough to keep them there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When we educate our health professionals in these types of areas,” said Derksen, “they tend to go into those areas to practice more often.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tackling the health insurance beast&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the biggest successes for rural America in recent years was the Affordable Care Act (ACA) — in particular, provisions for the expansion of Medicaid in states, and subsidies to offset the cost of health insurance for many people. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Those two factors halved our uninsured [in Arizona],” said Derksen. “Before these coverage provisions of the Affordable Care Act went into place, of our 6.5 million total population, 1.2 million were uninsured. We halved that.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These factors also revitalized small, rural hospitals — known as Critical Access Hospitals. These hospitals, which have 25 beds or less and are 35 miles or more from another facility, serve a sparse population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If someone without insurance shows up at a hospital needing care, most hospitals will treat them. This “charity care” is a drain on all hospitals, but more so on small ones that you find in rural areas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Increased insurance coverage through Medicaid and federal insurance subsidies relieved some of this burden.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Rural and critical access hospitals across the country have been closing at a very disturbing rate,” said Derksen. “That decline was certainly stabilized with the sharp reduction in uncompensated care, as more people were covered.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the Republican-controlled Congress already dismantling the ACA, the future health of people living in rural areas — like the healthcare system itself — remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“A lot of us in public health are apprehensive,” said Derksen. “I think ‘repeal and replace’ is a catchy phrase. It has a nice alliteration, but it’s not a health plan. It’s not a public health intervention in itself.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/2016/11/14/501737150/rural-voters-played-a-big-part-in-helping-trump-defeat-clinton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rural voters&lt;/a&gt; played a big part in President Donald Trump’s election in November.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Any politician would be prudent to pay attention to the constituents that got them into office,” said Derksen. “What I’m hopeful for is that there will be more health policy attention paid to rural populations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

an Francisco-based startup that creates wearable diagnostics, is developing a product that promises to provide real-time feedback on the wearer’s health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only thing it needs to measure this data is sweat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kenzen.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ECHO Smart Patch&lt;/a&gt; is a small, flexible, adhesive patch that connects wirelessly to a monitor to measure the wearer’s vital signs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kenzen executives hopes the device will become available online to consumers by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It continuously measures a wide range of biometrics and gathers reliable data to monitor health, and predict and prevent injuries and avoidable health conditions,” Dr. Sonia Sousa, chief executive officer and co-founder of Kenzen, told Healthline in an email. “Individual physiology varies, but most users begin sweating after approximately 15 to 20 minutes of heavy exertion. The sweat is transported across the ECHO Smart Patch to its sensors, which immediately begin analyzing various biomarker concentrations.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experts interviewed by Healthline say the device shows promise, but it will take time for medical professionals to properly apply the data it measures to individuals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Sweat provides insights&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;While not as common as blood tests, sweat tests can provide valuable information on a person’s health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Lots of things can be measured in sweat and the new technology to do so is interesting,” Dr. Benjamin D. Levine, director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine, told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cystic fibrosis, for instance, is generally diagnosed using a simple test that measures salt levels in a patient’s sweat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Performance labs will also swab athletes before and after a workout session in order to gather data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sousa says that sweat contains several biomarkers that can help assess an individual’s health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Minerals such as sodium and potassium can be detected, but surprisingly, sweat also holds proteins, hormones, and larger molecules like glucose, lactate, and cortisol, which can be used to measure calorie intake and output, muscle fatigue, and even stress levels,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s really a way to look at electrolyte balance,” Dr. James Borchers, head team physician for athletics, and director of medical services for The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told Healthline. “Performance and biomarkers and athletes’ health are definitely areas where a lot of people are looking to the future because they don’t want to be invasive and do a blood draw, a finger stick, or something like that, in order to get this information.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Blood panels are, and will likely continue to be, the gold standard for full clinical assessment,” notes Sousa. “We believe, however, that people need continuous measurements, in context, in order to get ahead of injuries and adverse health conditions. Drawing blood just isn’t easy, affordable, or convenient. And although not a direct correlation to blood, sweat provides a wealth of information about an individual’s health, is readily available, and can be collected and measured painlessly.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The next generation in fitness tracking?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The wearable technology industry has been projected to be worth &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.forbes.com/sites/paullamkin/2016/02/17/wearable-tech-market-to-be-worth-34-billion-by-2020/#388c93f03fe3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;$34 billion&lt;/a&gt; by 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most fitness trackers use relatively simple technology to measure step counts, heart rate, and little else — but that is poised to change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001402&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stanford University study&lt;/a&gt;, released this month, concluded that wearable biosensors can provide useful health data and “might be used as a diagnostic tool to spot disease early.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers added that it will take some time before this technology finds its way into the hands of consumers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kenzen’s patch, assuming it’s released on schedule, is poised to become one of the first advanced wearable biosensors to become widely available. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Borchers says a sweat-monitoring patch could be useful in a sports context.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think it could be applied to, for example, endurance athletes, to look at their performance and their health. Same thing for football players. I do think it could give athletic trainers, coaching staffs, and physicians a lot of information about athletes and their training, and what their needs could be moving forward,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kenzen’s team echoes this, focusing on professional and elite-level athletes as an initial go-to-market strategy before trickling down to other athletes and consumers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The company has partnered with two professional sports team — the National Football League’s San Francisco 49ers as well as FC Dallas of Major League Soccer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The technology shows promise, but Levine cautions that it will take some time for the health community to properly apply the data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Right now, the technology appears to be ahead of the knowledge required to use the information appropriately in making decisions about individual patients or athletes,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the technology is still in its infancy, Kenzen has big plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Imagine that you get a notification before you get hurt, sick, or develop a more serious medical condition. Would your behavior change? How much could we save on expensive medical treatments if chronic conditions could be detected earlier? Could coaches and trainers preempt costly injuries by pulling players off the field before they cramp up? Would you have more peace of mind if you could remotely monitor your kids’ or mother’s hydration level?” asks Sousa. “We believe all of these things could soon be a reality, and we’re committed to keeping our users safe. Kenzen’s mission is to predict and prevent avoidable injuries and adverse health conditions — and we plan to do this using a simple little patch.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

They showed that the CD8 T cells could be triggered to kill CD4 cells when they were cultured with a dual-functioning antibody that was made to target the virus and dispatch CD8 T cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They say that these bispecific antibodies could be a treatment strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, they emphasize the use of bispecific antibodies may be considered as part of a “shock-and-kill” treatment strategy in those people taking suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) for extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johnston said this approach addresses two main challenges in HIV research: How to access and how to kill infected cells. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“They engineered an antibody that may solve both issues. It takes the brakes off killer T cells and lets them do what they’re designed for, that is, kill virus-infected cells where they live,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The results are promising, but to prove it works it must be tested in people with HIV.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Antonio Urbina, an associate professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, was also optimistic about the results of the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“But in order to truly eradicate HIV, the potent CD8 T cell responses would also need to penetrate other reservoir sites outside of lymph tissue, for example, the central nervous system,” he told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Power in numbers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the other study, researchers found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/373/eaal2144?utm_source=MedPak%20%28updated%201/13/2017%29&amp;amp;utm_campaign=c0802a1630-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_01_13&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_5f99005e3a-c0802a1630-126535389&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;three antibodies&lt;/a&gt; could neutralize and stall the virus. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most people with HIV, the virus spreads rapidly throughout the body and goes undetected by the immune system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In rare cases, though, some people develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that keep the pathogen hidden for extended periods of time. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While doing research on treating humanized mice, researchers discovered three bNAbs in one person. Scientists believe the bNAbs can keep HIV infection from progressing to AIDS over a span of 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When they looked at that person’s virus five times between 2006 and 2015, they found that the HIV was vulnerable to neutralization by at least one of the antibodies. In total, a single bNAb was associated with decreased virus, and all three together lowered it 10 times over. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, the researchers believe that the three bNAbs could be used as a passive immunotherapy. Further clinical trials are needed to evaluate its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Johnston noted that the combination of antibodies can prevent a treatment-resistant virus from emerging. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It would be very interesting to know whether the antibodies … can not only neutralize the virus, but also kill the cells that produce it,” Johnston noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
