Apparently, <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/selena-gomez-57535919/" target="_blank"><strong>Selena Gomez</strong> </a>and <strong><a href="http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/the-weeknd-59000444/" target="_blank">The Weeknd</a> </strong>are booed up and we're just not sure how to feel about it. <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/11/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-kissing-photos/">According to TMZ, </a>yesterday evening, the paparazzi caught Selena Gomez and The Weeknd aka Abel Tesfaye sharing a smooch outside of a Los Angeles restaurant. The pair were all smiles and Gomez was practically draped across <em>The Starboy</em> singer's body. The<em> <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/tv/wizards-of-waverly-place-59527975/" target="_blank">Wizards of Waverly Place</a></em> alum has been single for some time now, and The Weeknd ended his long term relationship with model, <strong>Bella Hadid</strong> back in November, but it looks like they won't be single for long.  <strong>Check out the photos below.</strong> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Selena Gomez and The Weeknd Making Out (PHOTO GALLERY) <a href="https://t.co/jTBlzhPj9d">https://t.co/jTBlzhPj9d</a></p> â€” TMZ (@TMZ) <a href="https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/819232310939688960">January 11, 2017</a></blockquote> <script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8">// <![CDATA[ // ]]&gt; </script> Though the two could just be super casual, the new romance is bound to cause a bit of drama at least amongst the members of <a href="http://www.hollywood.com/celebrities/taylor-swift-57684356/" target="_blank">Taylor Swift</a>'s infamous Squad. If you recall, Gomez and TSwift are besties and they are also both friends with model <strong>Gigi Hadid</strong>, Bella Hadid's sister. Still, if this is the romance that dissolves the squad, we'll certainly take it. From the looks of things, SG is already super invested. What do you think about this romance that no one saw coming?
