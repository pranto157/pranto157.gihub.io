The PM was asked questions on a variety of topics, so here are all the important things we gleaned from the one-on-one.</p>\n<h2>On the the NHS</h2>\n<p><img src="https://snappa.assets.pressassociation.io/2017/01/08114728/1483876046-dcf8698c7e4275ae15807f8d50dd06ff-600x405.jpg" alt="Theresa May"></p><figure>(John Stillwell/PA)</figure><p>May rejected claims of the \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d the British Red Cross says plagues the health system, but she does acknowledge there are \u201chuge pressures\u201d on the NHS.</p>\n<p>She told Ridge: \u201cYes there are significant pressures, but we recognise those pressures.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe asked the NHS a while back to set out what it needed over the next five years in terms of its plan for the future and the funding that it would need. They did that, we gave them that funding, in fact we gave them more funding than they required. So funding is now at record levels for the NHS, more money has been going in.\u201d</p>\n<p>She noted the UK\u2019s ageing population as a particular concern, which is why she says \u201cit is important that it is the NHS that has produced its five-year plan and is now putting that plan into practice.\u201d</p>\n<figure></figure><blockquote data-width="474" class="twitter-tweet"><figure></figure><p lang="en" xml:lang="en"><figure>Not correct for May to say NHS always faces these winter problems: Labour rescued the NHS, the Tories have plunged it in to crisis <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ridge?src=hash">#Ridge</a></figure></p>\n<p><figure>\u2014 Labour Press Team (@labourpress) <a href="https://twitter.com/labourpress/status/818048012647890944">January 8, 2017</a></figure></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><figure></figure></p>\n<p>Labour has called for May or Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to make an emergency statement on the NHS when Parliament returns on Monday.</p>\n<h2>On Brexit</h2>\n<p><img src="https://snappa.assets.pressassociation.io/2017/01/08114754/1483876071-d1d65b5e13abeaf050034efc8b1e63b0-600x423.jpg" alt="Theresa May"></p><figure>(John Stillwell/PA)</figure><p>Brexit was understandably high on Ridge\u2019s agenda, and when discussing the EU May denied any \u201cmuddled thinking\u201d on the part of the Government.</p>\n<p>The PM insisted she will be able to secure control over immigration to the UK as well as favourable trading terms with the EU during Brexit negotiations, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong to look at this as just a binary issue as to either you have control of immigration or you have a good trade deal.\u201d</p>\n<figure></figure><blockquote data-width="474" class="twitter-tweet"><figure></figure><p lang="en" xml:lang="en"><figure>Soft Brexit supporters won\'t find much to like in Theresa May\'s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ridge?src=hash">#ridge</a> interview.

We are leaving. We are coming out. We are not going to be a member of the EU any longer.\u201d</p>\n<p>She said that the aim was to take control of the UK\u2019s borders and laws: \u201cBut of course we still want the best possible deal for us, companies to be able to trade, UK companies to be able to trade in and operate within the European Union and also European companies to be able to trade with the UK and operate within the UK.\u201d</p>\n<p>May said she was concentrating on \u201cnot the means to the end but what the outcome is\u201d as she looks ahead to negotiating Brexit.</p>\n<h2>On Donald Trump</h2>\n<p><img src="https://snappa.assets.pressassociation.io/2017/01/08114825/1483876103-a70b5d41267acffcfc2aa633e7efcbd2-600x399.jpg" alt="Theresa May"></p><figure>(John Stillwell/PA)</figure><p>As the president-elect had recently tweeted that he was looking forward to meeting May, Ridge asked the PM a bit more about her thoughts on Trump\u2019s comments regarding women \u2013 not only as a leader, but as a woman.</p>\n<p>May said Trump\u2019s comments from a 2005 recording about grabbing women by the genitals were \u201cunacceptable\u201d, but added \u201cthe relationship the UK has with the US is something much bigger than the relationship between the President and PM.\u201d</p>\n<figure></figure><blockquote data-width="474" class="twitter-tweet"><figure></figure><p lang="en" xml:lang="en"><figure>I look very much forward to meeting Prime Minister Theresa May in Washington in the Spring.
