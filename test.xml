<p><strong>Industry:</strong> Public-relations account executive</p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 25</p><p><strong>Location:</strong> Washington, D.C.</p><p><strong>Salary:</strong> $56,000</p><p><strong>Paycheck Amount (2x a month):</strong> $1,570.27 after taxes and 401(k) contribution are taken out. Iâ€™ve been working with a financial planner since 2013, when I graduated from grad school and started working full-time, and my retirement portfolio currently consists of a Roth IRA, 401(k), and whole-term life insurance policy.</p><p><strong>Number of roommates:</strong> None</p><p><strong>Monthly Expenses</strong></p><p><strong>Mortgage:</strong> $862.11 (Iâ€™m lucky that my monthly mortgage is low as a result of my parents giving me a large down payment for my studio.)</p><p><strong>Condo Fee:</strong> $374</p><p><strong>Car Insurance:</strong> $79.99 (My parents bought me my car in college.)</p><p><strong>Loans:</strong> $0 (My parents paid for my grad school.)</p><p><strong>Birchbox:</strong> $10</p><p><strong>Comcast (TV/Internet):</strong> $104.57</p><p><strong>Cell Phone:</strong> $89.64</p><p><strong>P</strong> <strong>re-Tax Metro Card Contribution:</strong> $40</p><p><strong>Whole-Term Permanent Life Insurance Policy:</strong> $220.16 (an investment as part of my retirement portfolio, not just for insurance purposes)</p><p><strong>Health Insurance:</strong> $0 (Iâ€™m on my parents' plan until I turn 26.)</p><p><h3>Day 1</h3> 9:02 a.m. â€” For breakfast, I grab a bagel with lox and cream cheese along with an orange. My office provides bagels, doughnuts, and fruit every Friday, which is definitely a nice perk at the end of each workweek.</p><p>11:37 a.m. â€” I make a coffee with my officeâ€™s Flavia machine. The coffee isnâ€™t bad and gives me a small pick-me-up.</p><p>12:30 p.m. â€” My company serves some leftovers from the office BBQ-themed happy hour we had yesterday, so itâ€™s a chili hot dog and baked beans for me for lunch.</p><p>4:32 p.m. â€” I go with a coworker to grab iced green tea at Peetâ€™s near our office. <strong>$2.81</strong></p><p>6:30 p.m. â€” I meet up with three friends for dinner and get a cocktail and lamb salad. We also share some delicious Afghan veggie appetizers. <strong>$29.55</strong></p><p>8:02 p.m. â€” I Uber home from the restaurant. <strong>$6.30</strong></p><p>8:20 p.m. â€” I pick up some soda to mix with whiskey, since my boyfriend and I are just having a relaxing movie night at my place with drinks. <strong>$2.19</strong></p><p><strong>Daily Total: $40.85</strong></p><p><h3>Day 2</h3> 9:30 a.m. â€” My boyfriend and I get some coffee at the coffee shop in my neighborhood. I get a chai-tea latte and he pays.</p><p>10:10 a.m. â€” We make one of my Marley Spoon meals that I received days earlier, which is a cook-at-home food-delivery service. We make â€œCrispy Rice and Vegetables with Shiitakes and Spicy Sesame Sauce." Itâ€™s an unusual breakfast, but tasty nonetheless.</p><p>2:43 p.m. â€” Weâ€™re heading to my friendâ€™s barbecue, so I pick up some salsa, chips, and a six-pack of beer to bring. <strong>$17.42</strong></p><p>3:36 p.m. â€” My boyfriend, friend, and I take a cab over to my friendâ€™s barbecue, which is in a neighborhood pretty far away from me in D.C., and we split three ways. <strong>$9.67</strong></p><p>4:02 p.m. â€” I eat ribs, pork belly, fajitas, smoked chicken wings, and some sides at the barbecue. Heavenly.</p><p>8:29 p.m. â€” We split another Uber from the barbecue to a housewarming in a different neighborhood. <strong>$7.59</strong></p><p><strong>Daily Total: $34.68</strong></p><p><h3>Day 3</h3> 11:30 a.m. â€” My boyfriend and I grab drinks as we wait for our brunch table. I pay. <strong>$8.60</strong></p><p>11:51 a.m. â€” For brunch, I order an omelet with tomatoes, peppers, and avocado. I also get a side of hash browns, toast, and coffee. Boyfriend pays.</p><p>4:25 p.m. â€” After playing tennis for most of the afternoon, I grab a Powerade. <strong>$2.89</strong></p><p>7:01 p.m. â€” I do a load of laundry in the laundry room of my condo building. <strong>$1</strong></p><p>7:31 p.m. â€” My boyfriend orders some Thai food â€” drunken noodles, papaya salad, and Tom Yum soup. I Venmo him for half of the cost. <strong>$13</strong></p><p>7:55 p.m. â€” I order a small Moleskine journal online from Amazon. <strong>$9.09</strong></p><p><strong>Daily Total: $34.58</strong></p><p><h3>Day 4</h3> 9:25 a.m. â€” Breakfast is coffee from my workâ€™s Flavia machine.</p><p>1:27 p.m. â€” I get out of a meeting and realize I still havenâ€™t eaten today. I eat leftover Thai drunken noodles from the night before that I brought to work, and I grab a Diet Dr. Pepper from the vending machine. <strong>$0.50</strong></p><p>1:44 p.m. â€” I buy a small salad from the cafÃ© in my office building to supplement my leftovers. <strong>$5.80</strong></p><p>5:32 p.m. â€” I decide to sign up for Green Chef, another cook-at-home food-delivery service. For my first week (which will be delivered next week), I receive six meals for the price of only two. <strong>$26.98</strong></p><p>8:01 p.m. â€” I make the last meal from the Marley Spoon box I received last week â€” a tomato-based cod stew over couscous.</p><p>Daily Total: <strong>$33.28</strong></p><p><h3>Day 5</h3> 9 a.m. â€” I drove to work rather than Metro, since Iâ€™m going to drive to book club right after work. I pay for my officeâ€™s garage parking. <strong>$12</strong></p><p>12:30 p.m. â€” I finish an already opened bag of wasabi-flavored chips and have some Progresso chicken-tortilla soup I had in my desk for lunch.</p><p>1:05 p.m. â€” During my lunch break, I pick up a birthday card at CVS for my friendâ€™s party this Friday. <strong>$2.63</strong></p><p>1:18 p.m. â€” I pick up a bottle of pinot grigio to bring to book club after work. <strong>$14.34</strong></p><p>1:29 p.m. â€” I havenâ€™t had caffeine yet today, and Iâ€™m starting to get the afternoon sleepies at work, so I make some coffee at the office.</p><p>6:40 p.m. â€” Thereâ€™s wine and food at book club, so dinner consists of pinot grigio, mac 'n' cheese, salad, chips, and cookies.</p><p><strong>Daily Total: $28.97</strong></p><p><h3>Day 6</h3> 11:40 a.m. â€” Busy morning at work, so I finally grab some coffee from workâ€™s Flavia.</p><p>1:50 p.m. â€” I finally get around to eating after a busy day at work full of meetings â€” tomato-based cod stew over couscous that I made the other day.</p><p>2:14 p.m. â€” I order <em>So You've Been Publicly Shamed Book</em> by Jon Ronson off Amazon for next monthâ€™s book club. <strong>$11.48</strong></p><p>7:55 p.m. â€” Taking advantage of the nice weather at a rooftop happy hour with a few girlfriends. I order margaritas, sangria, nachos, and tacos. <strong>$35.70</strong></p><p>9:01 p.m. â€” I take a Lyft home instead of Uber, since Lyft is having a 50% off deal. <strong>$5.37</strong></p><p><strong>Daily Total: $52.55</strong></p><p><h3>Day 7</h3> 10:40 a.m. â€” Office coffee again.</p><p>1 p.m. â€” I meet my boyfriend at Nandoâ€™s for lunch since he works relatively close to me.

I use a $2 coupon. <strong>$0.76</strong></p><p>6:20 p.m. â€” Iâ€™m craving mac 'n' cheese, so I pick up some Kraft along with broccoli and make that for dinner. Hoping the broccoli balances out the mac 'n' cheese. <strong>$6.08</strong></p><p><strong>Daily Total: $9.87</strong></p>     <figure>

   <title>What You Need To Know About Diabetes</title>
   <link>http://www.refinery29.com/signs-of-diabetes?utm_source=newscred&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
   <guid>http://www.refinery29.com/signs-of-diabetes?utm_source=newscred&amp;utm_medium=rss</guid>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>Across the globe, the rate of diabetes has skyrocketed â€” <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2016/04/107793/diabetes-quadrupled-statistics-study">quadrupled</a>, in fact â€” in the last few decades. As of 2012, <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/statistics/">over 9%</a> of the U.S. population has diabetes â€” and more than 8.1 million people who have it don't know it, according to the American Diabetes Association. We spoke with <a href="http://nyulangone.org/doctors/1972745149/dorothy-a-fink">Dorothy Fink, MD</a>, an endocrinologist at NYU Langone Medical Center, to find out what you need to know about the condition, including its main warning signs.</p><p><strong>What's the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?</strong></p><p>To understand the two diseases, you have to first understand what's <em>supposed</em> to happen. After eating â€” if you're healthy â€” your digestive system will break down food into basic sugars (a.k.a. glucose) that it can use as fuel. In order for it to do that, though, your pancreas has to release the hormone insulin, which acts like a key for each of your cells, unlocking them so the glucose can enter and be used for fuel. But in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, there is a kink in this system.</p><p>Dr. Fink explains that type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune response, which means that antibodies from a patient's own immune system start to attack the pancreas, damaging it and preventing it from producing insulin. Without the insulin, the body's cells can't use the glucose, so it builds up in the blood, causing the "high blood sugar" that can be dangerous. People with type 1 usually have to rely on insulin injections to make sure their bodies can regulate their blood sugar and their cells get the fuel they need.</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, can still make insulin, but their bodies have become resistant to the hormone, so it isn't as effective at moving the glucose into the cells. Over time, people with type 2 may also stop making enough insulin, eventually becoming dependent on insulin medication, just like a patient with type 1 diabetes, Dr. Fink says.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1, which is usually diagnosed in childhood or adolescence (though it can be <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/diabetes-diagnosis-affects-italian-identity">diagnosed in adults, as well</a>).</p><p><strong>What are the early signs of diabetes?</strong></p><p>The symptoms of type 1 tend to come on suddenly, and may include irritability and mood changes, increased thirst and urination, fatigue and extreme hunger.</p><p>With type 2, however, the symptoms are more gradual. "Itâ€™s not like someone wakes up one day and theyâ€™re a full-blown diabetes patient," explains Dr. Fink. "The sad reality is that [it develops over time and] it's silent."</p><p>However, once someone has developed type 2, Dr. Fink says the signs can be similar to type 1: intense thirst, peeing a lot more (including getting up to go during the night), feeling fatigued, and possibly, blurred vision. These symptoms, particularly the need to pee, can also be signs of <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/frequent-urination">many other less serious issues</a>, too, so you should definitely see your doctor, who can do tests to find out what's really going on.</p><p><strong>What about prediabetes?</strong></p><p>"Patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are going to have a state before they get to true diabetes when the pancreas isnâ€™t working as well as it should be," Dr. Fink explains. But when we're talking about "<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/basics/definition/con-20024420">prediabetes</a>," we're talking about type 2 diabetes. A prediabetes diagnosis means that your blood sugar is elevated, but not yet high enough to warrant a full-blown type 2 diagnosis. Insulin resistance can actually be reversed with lifestyle changes, like diet and exercise, if caught during prediabetes, making it a critical window for changing your habits.</p><p>There are a lot of complicated factors that contribute to your risk for insulin resistance, but you're more likely to develop prediabetes (and diabetes) if you're overweight, have a family history of the disease, have <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2016/04/109249/pcos-symptoms-real-women">polycystic ovarian syndrome</a> (PCOS), or come from certain ethnic backgrounds (Asian- and African-Americans are most at-risk).</p><p>While the rise in diabetes is related to the obesity epidemic, we also know that weight alone isn't necessarily a <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/bmi-alternatives">reliable predictor</a> of problems on an individual level. No matter how heavy you are, the thing to remember is that it's lifestyle that matters most: "If you're addicted to processed carbohydrates, eat everything on the run, sit at a desk all day, never exercise, and have a family history of diabetes, those are all major factors to take into account," Dr. Fink says.</p><p>It's important to check with your doctor about your risk for diabetes, get your blood-glucose levels checked regularly (this is often a routine part of an annual check-up), and if necessary, make <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/basics/prevention/con-20033091">those lifestyle changes</a> everyone's always talking about. "It's easier to think of food and exercise as medicine than it is to <em>take</em> medicine," Dr. Fink says. And it's better to start thinking of those things as medicine sooner rather than later.</p>]]></description>

   <title>I've Been To 70 Countries â€” &amp; Here's What I Regret</title>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>By its very nature, travel taps into the adventurous side of our personalities. It pushes us into new directions and inspires us to do things we normally wouldnâ€™t do, perhaps <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/traveling-outside-comfort-zone">outside of our comfort zones</a>. Iâ€™ve certainly bought into that mentality, having visited more than 70 countries.</p><p>When faced with a â€œshould I or shouldnâ€™t I?â€ proposition, Iâ€™m more likely to dive in and make the most out of my travel time. But I can say now that there have been many times when I wished I hadnâ€™t fallen prey to a "just do it" mentality. Regrets? I have a few â€” ones that still haunt me and make me wish Iâ€™d tempered my zeal for new and different with more common sense and awareness.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/9df/1200x900,80/1609263/image.jpg" width="1200" height="900"/>

<p>When I think about my visit to the Dominican Republic, I feel sick recalling my experience swimming with the dolphins at Ocean World. The Royal Swim package includes being able to grab on to the pectoral fins of a pair of dolphins and go for a â€œrideâ€ through the water. I was one of about a dozen people in my hour-long session, which included an orientation and half an hour in the water, where guests were allowed to hug, kiss, pet, and feed the animals. The moment I hit the enclosed pool, I wondered why I was there.</p><p>It was filthy. As I waited for my turn with the dolphins, I tried in vain to splash away the copious amount of feces floating in the water. Once I had my ride, I got out of the pool and went to get changed. I wasn't elated like the others in my group. I felt sad as I passed the photo souvenir shop and saw my grimace in the digital picture of me petting one of the dolphins. I thought of them repeatedly being fondled by tourists, all day long, in that dirty water, under the guise of education. My time with the dolphins really was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but in a bad way.</p><p>Foolishly, I thought my swim with manta rays in Antigua would be different, since our group was told that they were out in the ocean and not in an enclosed pool. Under dark skies, we hopped into a small boat and headed to the rays. The clouds looked nearly black, and the wind was blowing with gusto. â€œAre you sure we should be going out in this?â€ I asked. â€œDonâ€™t worry. It will be fine,â€ I was told. Not wanting to be a party pooper, I shrugged off my concerns.</p><p>The rays were in the ocean, as advertised, but penned in on all sides. The guide jumped into the enclosure, dove down to grab one of the rays, and lifted it out of the water. He flipped it upside down to show us its underbelly as the creature gasped for air; then, nearby, there was a crack of thunder and a flash of lightning. A storm was rolling in, and we were sitting ducks out in the open ocean, with nowhere to take shelter.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s3.r29static.com//bin/entry/8c1/1200x900,80/1609264/image.jpg" width="1200" height="900"/>

<p>The skies opened up, and the rain whipped against my skin; it felt like the sting of thousands of needles. We huddled in the boat and tried to curl up as small as we could. You could feel the electricity ripple through the air with every lightning strike. As the storm raged on, I thought, <em>This is how I'm going to die</em>. Fortunately, that didnâ€™t happen. I was livid that we had been put in danger by a tour operator who preferred to risk it than refund our money. I was also mad at myself for going along with something when I felt it could be dangerous â€” and for not asking about whether the rays were captive or not.</p><p>In Florence, Italy, I didnâ€™t think I was putting myself in jeopardy when I went to the apartment of a gay man Iâ€™d met at a cafÃ©; he said that he could sell me some leather goods at a decent rate, since he had designed them. After I sat on his sofa and looked through a catalog of stuff he sold, I was shocked when he put a cassette tape into his boom box, said he wanted to do a special dance for me, and unzipped his pants.</p><p>I bolted from the room, down the stairs, and ran like mad through the maze of streets of central Florence. He was running after me. I ended up near the Uffizi museum and near a policeman. â€œGet lost!â€ I screamed. â€œIf you come any closer to me, Iâ€™m going to get you arrested.â€ He left. No more impromptu visits to the homes of strangers for me.</p>     <blockquote>Sometimes the most responsible thing is to just say no to a new experience.</blockquote>
<p>If youâ€™ve been to India, you know that it can be an onslaught to the senses: the colors; the din of the traffic; the men roaming the streets with pots of chai; and the smells of sewage, animals, and bougainvillea. Poverty is at a level very foreign to most Westerners. Itâ€™s humbling and angering in equal measure. When four very polite children approached me and asked me for money in Mumbai, I instantly went for my wallet, handing out U.S. $1 bills to the crew.</p><p>Later, when I asked about the prevalence of panhandlers and street kids, my guide chastised me for giving them money. She explained that organized gangs use kids to approach tourists and that any cash I forked over would never better the lives of these youngsters. Panhandling was a business, and children were recruited specifically to appeal to unknowing, well-meaning suckers like me. Lesson learned. Or was it?</p><p>When I was near the border of Haiti on an eco-tour on horseback, I came prepared with notebooks, pencils, crayons, and pocket calculators for the local school kids whom I knew Iâ€™d meet at our stop in a small village. I was happy to play Santa Claus and dole out those little gifts when we met the kids along the riding path. But as I did, I noticed that the tour leader didnâ€™t look too happy. Later, I approached him. â€œDid I do something wrong?â€</p><p>Yes. Indeed, I did. It turns out that the kids know the schedule for the excursion I took quite well. When they know that there are tourists coming, they skip class in order to greet them and hopefully get gifts and/or money. I learned that the better option is to give directly to the school, and it will make sure the kids get the stuff â€” most importantly, <em>while</em> theyâ€™re attending school.</p><p>Through the years, Iâ€™ve become a more careful traveler. I donâ€™t make assumptions about how I can help the communities I visit. I ask a lot of questions and do my own research about any planned activities, especially those involving animals. And Iâ€™ve learned to listen to my gut when it tells me that maybe I should sit this one out.</p><p>Sometimes the most responsible thing is to just say no to a new experience. I donâ€™t have to do it all.</p>]]></description>

   <title>Why Quitting My Job Was The Best Decision I Ever Made</title>
   <link>http://www.refinery29.com/customer-service-job-experience?utm_source=newscred&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>
   <guid>http://www.refinery29.com/customer-service-job-experience?utm_source=newscred&amp;utm_medium=rss</guid>
   <description><![CDATA[<p>The fact that I was crying quietly on the phone as a stranger yelled at me wasnâ€™t surprising. I had always hated the phone. As a child, I was terrified of calling my friends to set up playdates. My one time volunteering for a phone bank was a disaster â€” I fled after 30 minutes when I encountered my first angry caller. And yet with that knowledge, I had agreed to take a job as a customer service representative that required me to talk to strangers. Not only strangers, but <em>angry</em> ones. Iâ€™m not sure anyone would say their calling in life is to be a customer service rep, but I was particularly ill-suited for this line of work. Yet, like so many twentysomethings navigating the uncertain job market circa 2013, I was stuck in a shitty job, hoping to figure out how to get something better.</p><p>I graduated from college with what I thought was an ironclad plan: I would apply to a year-long fellowship in Philadelphia, get exposure to the non-profit industry, and then get a full-time job doing something similar, which I would presumably do until I retired.</p><p>It took me less than a month to realize I was wrong. The fellowship itself was fine, but I realized that my interest in education reform wasnâ€™t enough to make me want to sit at a desk and cold-call principals in high-needs schools to offer the services of our very odd stable of volunteers. I spent 11 months in limbo and ended the year with no more insight into what I wanted to do â€” other than <em>not this</em>.</p>     <blockquote>I was stuck in a shitty job, hoping to figure out how to get something better</blockquote>
<p>As an escape, I spent time reading about food, which is why applying to a social media internship at a cooking company seemed like as good an idea as anything. It didnâ€™t matter that I had never been to Boston and didn't have many friends there â€” a day after my fellowship ended, I was driving north to an apartment I had only seen in pictures.</p><p>Moving to Boston came with its own shocks, but after a year of spinning my wheels, I felt good. I spent my free time alone, but it was summer, and I thought it would get better. Midway through the internship, an opportunity to work full-time at the company opened up, and I took it without much hesitation. I didnâ€™t know what else to do or where else to go. I had made college work for me, despite my initial hesitations about living so far from home. I could make Boston work, too.</p><p>I became the sole customer service representative for the companyâ€™s online cooking school, a relatively new endeavor. I responded to inquiries via phone and email, and, in my free time, I wrote for the blog. My job came with a long list of pre-written responses to every kind of customer inquiry, from â€œI love your chicken soup!â€ (â€œThanks for the feedback, weâ€™ll let the cooks know!â€) to â€œWhy wonâ€™t the website accept my credit card?â€ (â€œItâ€™s probably a caching problem, here is our best attempt to explain how to clear your browser history to someone who has no idea what that is.â€)</p><p>But I hardly got to use any of those responses. The vast majority of the inquiries had to do with just one issue: â€œWhy are you billing me?â€ Our biggest source of new students came via a free trial offered when customers signed up for another one of our sites. Some people entered their credit card numbers twice without even realizing what they were doing. Other people didnâ€™t realize that you had to cancel both services to avoid being charged. Either way, they wanted to stop being charged for a service they werenâ€™t using, and they wanted it done yesterday.</p>     <blockquote>The vast majority of the inquiries had to do with just one issue: 'Why are you billing me?'</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, the callers would be embarrassed. Many of the customers just wanted to yell at someone, even if it wouldnâ€™t do much good. If they asked for their money back, I could offer up to a 60-day refund. If that wasnâ€™t good enough, they might demand to speak to my supervisor, a person who didnâ€™t really exist in the traditional sense. The VP of the entire digital department had hired me, and he wasnâ€™t really in the business of flagging calls from pissed-off home-cooking fans. There wasnâ€™t much I could do but respond politely, give refunds, and wish the customer well.</p><p>I realize some people do this for years, even for their entire careers, in call centers where the phone rings nonstop. My calls came through intermittently, and for the most part, I spent the day responding to emails, which were easier to handle. Still, it was thankless, monotonous work, and I was floundering.</p><p>I was too thin-skinned to absorb the rage of these faceless customers. I would cry silently as I apologized for their frustration. Some days, I would hold it together in the office only to burst into tears on my lunch break. When I moved to Boston, I fell in love with the New England summers. Now, I was dealing with the other side of the coin: the long, cold winters. To get away from my desk (and the ringing phone), I would sit in a small neighborhood park, my mood perfectly matched by gray skies and leafless trees. If I called my mom, just hearing her voice was enough to trigger the waterworks. Once, all it took was seeing a lost glove on the sidewalk. I was struck with such a sense of sorrow for that poor, lost glove â€” and I started sobbing, right there.</p><p>I never thought of quitting without another job lined up, but I didnâ€™t really see how I could stay. Logistically, I was too emotionally wrung-out at the end of the day to write cover letters, and the thought of waiting it out while I built my escape ladder was becoming untenable. I was debt-free, single, and childless. The only thing tethering me to Boston was this job and a lease on the apartment. The breaking point came when I told my mom how badly I wanted to leave. Most of my friends were happily living in New York. She asked how many people I knew there, and when I listed names in the double digits, she told me to go ahead and do it. It was all the encouragement I needed.</p>     <blockquote>I was struck with such a sense of sorrow for that poor, lost glove â€” and I started sobbing, right there.</blockquote>
<p>My misery was more apparent than I realized. My boss showed no surprise when I told him I was leaving. He also didnâ€™t ask me to stay, either. I agreed to work past my two weeks' notice, I sold all my furniture, I rented a minivan to hold my clothes and cat, and I moved to New York City.</p><p>Coincidentally (and metaphorically), my first day in NYC was Easter. Even as a lapsed Episcopalian, I savored the symbolism. This was a rebirth. What followed was a cobbled-together life of paid and unpaid work: I nannied, I interned for free or very little, I found a steady gig as a freelance audio producer. It paid enough that I could cover rent, but not well enough that I could get comfortable. I turned my <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/online-job-search#slide">job application process into a well-oiled machine</a>, and that led to my current job at Refinery29.</p><p>Looking back, it all seems like a tidy narrative. I am sometimes tempted to think of it as fate. But even if I still appreciate occasional religious symbolism, I know that nothing, however nicely packaged, is meant to be. I got lucky â€” luck that was also mixed with a healthy dose of hard work and talent. But maybe thatâ€™s a lesson in and of itself: If youâ€™re willing to take the risk, one day, you might be able to create a narrative out of it. If working customer service is the reason I now am where I am, then I can be grateful for that.</p>]]></description>

   <title>I Took Sexy Photos For My Boyfriend &amp; Here's How It Went</title>
   <link>http://www.refinery29.com/body-positive-boudoir-photography?utm_source=newscred&amp;utm_medium=rss</link>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>The first time Harry asked me, I picked a fight with him. Why would he even suggest such a thing? It was creepy and objectifying, and I was an adult woman with agency and self-respect. I knew this was an issue that often came up in relationships, and I came prepared to fight with a litany of feminist rhetoric and healthy boundaries. I won in a knock-out, in 90 seconds flat.</p><p>I'm speaking of course of "boudoir" pictures. Though Harry, my boyfriend, is a skilled photographer, I've come to discover that virtually everyone's had the sexy-pictures talk at some point in their romantic lives. Sometimes it's just a casual getting-dressed snapshot and other times it's amateur porn, but since the advent of photographic technology, we've been using it for nudie pics. On the one hand, I get it: When you love someone or see the beauty in their bodies, you want to capture that as a treasure you hold dear. On the other hand: Um, fuck off, perv.</p><p>To be clear: Harry never pushed. He's not a pusher by nature (that's <em>my</em> issue, thank you very much). About a year into our relationship, when he quietly asked, "Could I maybe take some sexy pictures of you sometime?" I understood that he had no ill intentions. I knew how many other women and girls had been manipulated in these situations, how horrific was the scourge of revenge porn. I also knew that Harry was the kind of guy who asked, "Is this okay?" before putting a hand around my waist beneath my t-shirt as we watched TV on the couch. I never had to worry about him respecting my boundaries or my body. His love for me as a whole was undeniable â€” as was his love for my body. That was the problem.</p><p>For years, I had said no to taking sexy pictures for very good reasons: I would not be made an object. I refused to be defined by my sexuality â€” or someone else's, rather. Bottom line, I wasn't comfortable, and I didn't need to apologize for that (not that he ever asked me to). But, righteous as my reasons were, they weren't really mine. Only recently did I realize what it came down to: shame. Always, shame.</p>     <figure>

     </figure>
<p>All women are forced to reckon with the element of shame when it comes to sexuality, even if it's only in a sociological sense (thanks, patriarchy!). As a plus-size woman â€” or anyone whose body flouts the beauty standard â€” there's often a bonus layer of shame. Being seen as non-normative means your sexuality is either invisible or fetishized. That's why a black and white, plus-size lingerie ad <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2015/04/86219/lane-bryant-plus-size-train-advertisements">on the subway</a> is seen as obscene, while the Victoria's Secret angels slink into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37WhPw9v3jw">prime ad space</a> during the Super Bowl â€” not only underdressed but "in the mood for love." A horny, thin woman is a-okay, but a plus-size woman better keep her sex life behind closed doors, with all the lights off, <em>please</em>.</p><p>That's where I kept mine, when I eventually got one. Until my late-twenties, I kept myself out of that game entirely. I had other reasons in addition to my size, but my size was a good enough excuse. So, when Harry and I got together, it was thrilling and new, but also slightly horrifying to find myself adored. I had a hard enough time looking at him looking at me with desire. Looking at myself? On camera? Nope.</p>     <figure>

      </figcaption>
     </figure>
<p>But if there's anything I've learned in the last three years, both in writing this column and growing in my relationship, it's that shame is a powerful tool when you learn how to wield it. If left unchecked, shame will back you into the darkest corner of your mind, hushing you into a fearful silence. That's no way to live, and it's certainly no way to live with someone else. But if you refuse to cower, if you stand up, turn on the lights, and start inviting people in, you quickly learn how utterly okay you really are. "Oh, so this is your dark corner?" they will say. "It looks just like mine, but with different wallpaper."</p><p>That's the power of exposing your shame. That's why I did photo shoots in <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/fatkini-plus-size-bikini-body-positivity">bikinis</a> and clothing that showed <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/vbo-plus-size-positivity">Visible Belly Outline</a>. Yet, still I resisted the idea of sexy pictures. Even after seeing other body positive boudoir photos from women like <a href="http://plussizeprincess.com/2016/02/how-to-create-a-bourdoire-photo-shoot-tips-for-every-body/">CeCe Olisa</a> and <a href="http://www.mslindsaym.com">Lindsey McAllister</a>, I held firm. It just felt different. I'd done my other photo shoots surrounded by professionals and I'd shared the pictures with a vast audience of strangers. There was something infinitely more vulnerable about revealing myself in this way with Harry, just the two of us, in our own home.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/d09/1200x900/1600107/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>

      </figcaption>
     </figure>
<p>The morning of the photo shoot, I laid out piles of brand new lingerie on my bed, assembling my looks. I put on some makeup and blew out my hair for the first time in months. When I'd told Harry I was finally up for taking these pictures (with another monologue outlining the good reasons I was doing this and the reasons I was <em>not</em>) he'd likely imagined something a little less formal: the two of us cozy and casual, lying around in bed on a Sunday morning. But if I was going to do this, I needed full control over all variables. I couldn't just be in my underwear. It had to be my underwear <em>looks</em>. If all this production made it any less sexy, oh well. Maybe that was the point.</p><p>After hours of preparation, I placed myself on the couch at last and looked into Harry's lens. We took the first few shots in relative silence, he adjusting lights and me yanking at my ensemble: a lacy bra, a crop top, and my favorite fuchsia undies. I adjusted my position constantly, trying to find a pose that said: <em>Look how confident I am both in my body and my sexuality, and yet I am clearly defined by neither</em>. Turns out, it's kind of a hard look to pull off, whether or not you're fully clothed. Still, I persevered, moving the arm that instinctively crept across my tummy to hide it. I flopped around trying to find the balance between looking comfortable and <em>being</em> comfortable. After maybe ten minutes of snap-adjustment-snap, I was already tired and feeling incurably awkward.</p><p>Then Harry peaked out from behind the camera, and his face was lit up with an open-mouthed smile. It was the kind of unbridled delight you see only on the face of someone who just cannot contain their love for you and their excitement to have you in their life. It wasn't lust, admiration, or pride, but a giddy mix of all of the above.</p><p>"You're a natural!" he cried, and in that moment I knew I was. The hair and makeup, all the frantic posing â€” I didn't need them to look good in this photos. I looked good in spite of all those things. These photos looked "good" because the person taking them was looking for me â€” not my best angle.</p><p>From that moment on, our little shoot became more fun. No, I wasn't cured of all self-consciousness; I still cringed or shied away at times. I still heard the voice in my head pipe up at times, calling me a big, fat show-off. But once again I learned the lesson that has changed my life: When you open your arms wide to shame, every single thing gets better. You move through the world with a little less fear. You don't become a brand new person, but rather, a little more yourself. You loosen your grip on control knowing that it doesn't really matter. You are who you are, and that is more than good enough.</p>     <figure>

      </figcaption>
     </figure>
<p>My body was always the thing I wished to control and never could. But I'd taken so much comfort in my efforts to shrink or obscure it. So, showing it to others now â€” and to the man I love â€” means stepping out of that dark corner in my mind (which some might call a comfort zone).</p><p>If I'm honest, there's part of me still on the fence about these photos. There's part of me that worries I'm trying to prove something I shouldn't have to. <em>You don't see a lot of men doing boudoir shoots to validate their worth</em>, I think. It's a fair point.</p><p>But my reasons for doing it are fair, too. I'm not defined by my sexuality, but it is a part of me. It took me a long time to claim it, so I'm going to embrace it now. And while intimacy is private, there is a message here that needs to be made public: Sensuality is everyone's right. It's still considered bold to see a plus-size body presented as normal. To see it as something lovable? That's advanced-level body positivity, and I think we're ready.</p><p>I spent so much of my life scared of being seen as a sexless lump or a fetish object. Really, I think I was afraid of being seen at all. But I am seen, and I am loved â€” and I'm learning to accept that (maybe even enjoy it?). In taking these photos, I don't feel I'm giving into those old definitions. There will always be someone trying to categorize me into something less than whole. That's not my problem anymore. What I refused to be defined by is shame.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.refinery29.com/the-anti-diet-project">The Anti-Diet Project</a> is an ongoing series about intuitive eating, sustainable fitness, and body positivity.

Well, for starters, she's got a Buddha tattooed on her arm.</p><p>The Zenned-out Philadelphia beauty is more than a pretty face â€” though that pretty face is also a Ford Model â€” Rogers is a pretty incredible rapper and DJ, too. Her father's love of old-school hip-hop and her mother's favorite neo-soul vibes are just a few of the influences you'll find in Rogers' tracks.</p><p>Sometimes known as the first lady of A$AP Mob, Rogers has the musical talent to stand alone. Her song, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DPHaWiHr7g">Selfie</a>," has a place right next to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3nPLoODtGU">J. J.

   <guid>http://www.refinery29.com/mothers-day-pumping-routine?utm_source=newscred&amp;utm_medium=rss</guid>
   <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Much of the parenting conversation has centered on the notion of having it all, but anyone who has even some of it knows that itâ€™s less about â€œhavingâ€ and more about â€œdoing.â€ Going to work, caring for your kids, fitting in friends and fitness â€” itâ€™s a lot to do. In our series</em> Mother's Day <em>, we ask some of the most highly functioning parents we know exactly what they fit into a typical day, and how the hell they do it.</em></p><p>For Karen*, 31, an archivist in Kansas City, MO, time management is the name of the game. At work, she handles sensitive documents and extremely exacting requests, and has to track her activities in six-minute increments (can you <em>even</em>?!). If her twice-daily pumping sessions exceed 15 minutes of break time, she has to start using her personal leave. Needless to say, sheâ€™s got her schedule down. We, on the other hand, are exhausted after reading it.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/818/1200x900/1609616/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>

<p><strong>Parenting with:</strong> My husband, Jake, 33, a software engineer.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/8ac/1200x900/1609608/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>My alarm goes off. About one second later, the baby starts babbling in his room. I wait it out for five minutes, pee, grab my phone, and head to the nursery, where I breast-feed him while checking email, Facebook, texts, and then change and dress the baby. This all takes about 40 minutes, then I drop him in the Pack 'n Play in my room and spend 10 to 20 minutes getting myself dressed for the day.</p><p>Knowing that my boobs and pumping shape a lot of my work life, my work apparel is whatever is quick to put on, doesnâ€™t get in the way when pumping, and is easy when it comes to laundry. I cram so much into the morning and evening, I often prioritize other things over showering. I was low maintenance pre-baby, but if it is at all possible, I am even more so now.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/e5e/1200x900/1609610/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>I grab Ben and head downstairs, give him some Cheerios in his high chair, feed the dog and let him outside, fill bottles with defrosted breast milk and label them for daycare, re-assemble all pump parts, and stock pump bag; around this time, husband gets up and gets dressed.</p><p>I let the dog in and get him set for the day, pack up baby, and get our seemingly endless number of bags loaded in the car; Jake comes down and we all leave together. We live in the suburbs, but both work downtown, so weâ€™ve got a commute, which we do together to save money on gas and parking. Itâ€™s also our time to talk about work, friends, life, or just be in the same place together, even if no one is talking. This takes the pressure off one of us to do all the drop-offs and pick-ups.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/b95/1200x900/1609606/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>We drop baby off at daycare tag-team style: I enter the door code, put bottles in the fridge, write up the daily sheet, and get items stored in his cubby; Jake signs in on the computer, unloads the baby, and stows the carrier; we both chat briefly with the teacher and head out to work.</p><p>Often, Ben's at daycare 9.5 to 10.5 hours during the day. We pay $273 a week with an annual $100 fee to keep our spot. This happens to be the most expensive location in our area (which we arenâ€™t super pumped about), but we both feel confident about our kid's safety and well-being there â€” you cannot put a price on having a sense of trust in your childâ€™s daycare.</p>     <blockquote>Pre-baby, I was a go-getter who took it all on, put up with anything, and sometimes struggled with work-life balance. I am still a leader in the office, but now I say 'no.'</blockquote>
     <figure>
      <img src="http://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/32e/1200x900/1609609/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>Arrive at work, sign in, check phone to make sure there are no missed calls from daycare (just in case), check calendar and plan ideal dayâ€™s activities, check email, voicemail, etc., and get to business. My job is 60% research and reference, answering extremely specific and often obscure questions about American history at a momentâ€™s notice; 30% records-based projects, preservation, and processing; and 10% administrative.</p><p>Iâ€™ve noticed an interesting shift in myself since returning to work. Pre-baby, I was a go-getter who took it all on, put up with anything and everything, and sometimes struggled with work-life balance. I am still a leader in the office, but now I say â€œnoâ€ and set limits; I produce at high rates, but wonâ€™t give up time with baby to make that happen; and have a much easier time managing others and providing feedback without taking it to heart. My sense of self isnâ€™t so heavily based on my role in the office now. My role as a mom has placed home life and happiness outside of work at a much higher priority level.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/0a3/1200x900/1609612/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>Pump (I have to fit set-up, pumping, and clean-up into a 15-minute â€œbreakâ€ or use leave time). Iâ€™m down to two pumping sessions at work, which has been a nice change. I still feel like my work day revolves around my boobs (hell, my whole life feels like it revolves around my boobs right now), but my day feels much less rigid than it did when I was using half of my lunch break to pump a third time. I look at pics of Ben, read personal email, check Facebook, follow up on health-insurance claims for his delivery and NICU stay (which are still in progress, 10-plus months later), make pediatrician appointments, and handle any other mom stuff, while on my pumping â€œbreaks.â€</p>     <blockquote>I have to be on and focused from when the alarm sounds to when baby finally goes to sleep.</blockquote>
<p>I do feel like being a mom is putting me in a tough position at work. I tend to be the parent who takes Ben to appointments, so I have to request off more than I did previously. Also, when he has rough nights, I canâ€™t just shut down or slack off for the day â€” my job requires me to be ready at any moment to assist researchers with complex issues, tackle challenging work with weighty legal ramifications, and sometimes navigate a 15-foot ladder carrying 50-pound boxes. Some days, my work is extremely mentally and physically taxing, and I donâ€™t have the chance to opt out, because baby was sick or woke up five times during the night. But I also canâ€™t opt out of mommy duties at home just because the work day was frustrating or tiring. I have to be on and focused from when the alarm sounds to when baby finally goes to sleep. Plus, pregnancy brain was <em>real</em> and I donâ€™t feel like I'm back firing at all pistons yet, even 10 months in.</p><p>After pumping, itâ€™s back to my email, voicemail, faxes (yep, we still use those), and I reassess my strategy for the afternoon.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/0bc/1200x900/1609607/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>I take a half-hour for lunch, which is whatever I cobbled together the night before. Iâ€™m all about pre-packaged items, like crackers and yogurt, but I try to throw in some fruit or veggies that are easy to pack up. I will not give up lunch, no matter how involved my work day may get â€” knowing that I am having a hard time staying connected to my friends outside work, I rely on that time to keep up with my colleagues on a personal level. My officemate calls me a â€œflaming extrovert,â€ so lunch gives me something of a social outlet.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/e84/1200x900/1609613/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>Pump session No. 2; same 15-minutes-or-else situation. Luckily, there is an open office that I can use (along with one other mother), and we can leave our pumps set up during the day. Our HQ on the East Coast has hospital-grade pumps (way more efficient), sinks, recliners, and refrigerators, which would be amazing to have. Weâ€™re jealous, but weâ€™re not complaining, because our space is comfortable, clean, and private. Iâ€™m so happy that breast-feeding generally has gone well for Ben and me, and pumping forces me to take breaks during the day. That said, I will not miss pumping. Not one bit.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s3.r29static.com//bin/entry/a77/1200x900/1609615/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>I wrap up at work and enter my dayâ€™s activities into a spreadsheet (our time is accounted for in 6-minute increments). I pick up Jake, then we head to daycare to get Ben.</p><p>I feel torn about sending him to daycare. I think he is well cared for, learning and experiencing lots, and is enjoying his little daycare buddies. I just hate having him spend so much of his day away from my husband and me. Heâ€™s often wiped at the end of the day and falls asleep in the car, which makes it even more tough, because neither of us feels like we are getting quality time with him. At home, we almost immediately dive into his nighttime routine. I also got spoiled with five-and-a-half months of maternity leave, so I got a taste of the ups and downs of being home with baby all day, every day. I loved my time with him and wouldnâ€™t have traded it for anything. Having had that time, though, it makes me want more.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/292/1200x900/1601232/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>Once home, I unpack our bags, store pumped milk and pull frozen milk to start defrosting for next dayâ€™s bottles, take pump apart, change out of work clothes, and check the daycareâ€™s notes to see what they need more of (diapers, wipes, change of clothes, etc). Two to three days a week, Jake uses this time to go to the gym.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s1.r29static.com//bin/entry/228/1200x900/1601234/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>I cook and serve Benâ€™s dinner; bathe him, change him into his pajamas; and sing songs, rock, and nurse him until heâ€™s drowsy. Meanwhile, Jake cooks our dinner. After about an hour, I put the baby down and come out of his room. Then, my husband and I eat. The best parenting hack in our house is just sticking to the schedule: It doesnâ€™t have to be rigid, but if everything happens in its window, life is good.</p>     <figure>
      <img src="http://s2.r29static.com//bin/entry/ca4/1200x900/1595670/image.png" width="1200" height="900"/>
     </figure>
<p>I wash baby bottles and pump parts, load dishwasher, pack lunch, and begin re-packing our bags for the next day. At 8:30, Iâ€™ll settle in to watch TV on my own or with Jake, and consider taking a shower (sometimes I actually take one). This is when Iâ€™ll get in touch with friends to try to make plans, call my mom, play with the dog, or tidy up. At 10:30, I hit the hay.</p>     <figure>

     <blockquote>You have to look big picture and try your best. Know that your baby is okay and you are okay.</blockquote>
<p><strong>How did you and your partner divide the duties in this way?</strong></p><p>"Breast-feeding has dictated a good portion of our scheduling, because I have to allow extra time to get baby fed and situated before I can address myself for the day. The original plan when I returned to work after maternity leave was that Jake would take care of our dog in the morning, but that slowly shifted to me and has just kind of stuck. I tend to be more detail-oriented, so Iâ€™ve defaulted into the position of organizer for getting us out the door.</p><p>"I do wish heâ€™d get up in the morning and help instead of sleeping for an extra hour while I scramble around. He is an amazing husband and father (I canâ€™t say enough about how impressed and proud I am that heâ€™s ours â€” he carries the load in so many areas), but in the morning, I just look at him with disdain and think, <em>Get up! Get UP! GET UP!</em> "</p><p><strong>Finish this sentence: I absolutely canâ€™t do it without...</strong></p><p>"Vegging out in front of the TV at some point during the day. I just need a little time to not be in charge of anyone and not have to think about ANYTHING. There isnâ€™t much right now that I do truly for myself, but I do try to make sure I get time to wind down, sneak chocolate from my secret stash, or wander Target for an hour or so when I just need to get away from home."</p><p><strong>What do working moms NEED to know?</strong></p><p>"There is no preparing for the pressures of being a mom of an infant and an employee. There is no way to accurately describe it in words. It can be a tough transition, but you have to look big picture and try your best. Know that your baby is okay and you are okay.</p><p>"Also, for breast-feeding moms, pumping sucks. It just does. BUT you can do it. Youâ€™ll stress about how much you are pumping, how much you need to be pumping, how long you need to pump in one day, how much you need to pump in one week, how long youâ€™ll pump before weaning, and on, and on, and on. Itâ€™s okay. Just focus on what you can control and find sources of support in your work and home life."</p><p><strong>How do you feel about your body now and how is that different from your self-image pre-baby?</strong></p><p>"I feel like Iâ€™ve always had a positive body image, but I hate the way clothes fit me now. I havenâ€™t settled into my post-baby style and nothing EVER fits right. Ever. Iâ€™ve been the exact same weight since a week after Ben was born (which is actually less than pre-baby), but my body is a different shape every few weeks â€” everything just keeps shifting around!"</p><p><strong>What postpartum symptoms have you had to deal with?</strong></p><p>"Honestly, the worst thing post-delivery was the weeks of sore legs. I was apparently holding my knees up with Hulk strength! I had a last-minute epidural to buy some time, because I was delivering five weeks early out of town and my husband was flooring it across the state to be there in time. The epidural was our last-ditch effort to halt the baby, by easing my desire to push. It worked! The epidural was amazing, but I had ZERO gauge on how hard I was holding onto my legs during delivery â€” and boy, did they ache afterwards."</p><p><strong>When did you first have sex after childbirth and what is intimacy like for you now?</strong></p><p>"We waited for seven to eight weeks before having sex. My husband was extremely turned on by seeing me as a new mom, so our level of intimacy during the no-sex period was actually higher than it had been for...years! We were much more physical during that time than we are even now. I wanted to wait until after I went to my six-week appointment to confirm everything was healing correctly and had been on birth control again for at least a week before we even considered doing anything down there. Our sex life hasnâ€™t actually changed too much since pre-kid, but it is significantly quieter. DO NOT WAKE THE BABY!"</p><p><em>Ed. note: If you're wondering if the time limitation on Karen's pumping breaks is legal, it is. The <a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs73.pdf">U.S. Department of Labor</a> only specifies that employees should be granted "a reasonable amount of break time" in which to pump. "Reasonable," of course, being subjective. And Karen lives in Missouri, a state that specifies in its <a href="http://health.mo.gov/living/families/wic/breastfeeding/laws.php">laws about breast-feeding in public</a> that it should be done "with discretion." It's no wonder <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2016/06/114017/target-employees-patrons-defend-breastfeeding-woman">this kind of thing</a> is still happening.</em></p><p><em>*Names have been changed.</em></p>]]></description>

   <title>The Ring I Made To Remember My Father By</title>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>My dad wasnâ€™t big on jewelry. I donâ€™t remember him wearing a wedding ring when he was married to my mother, though, frankly, I barely remember them being married. I vaguely recall a silver band with some sort of turquoise during his second marriage, but it bent and chipped and was either lost or banished to some drawer even before that, too, ended in divorce. A Fossil watch Iâ€™d gifted him was stolen from his car. When I asked why the watch was in his car and not on his wrist, heâ€™d shrugged and said that itâ€™d been too flashy to wear out, so heâ€™d never taken it out of the case.</p><p>We did, however, find a green and navy loom bracelet my nephew had once made him. Heâ€™d kept it, and as he lay dying and semi-conscious in the palliative care unit in a Santa Fe hospital last June, my sister, brother, and I put all our effort into keeping that piece of rubber close. The clasp had snapped at some point, so we could only place it in his big, warm hand, pressing it closer as we held hands with him for the first time since childhood. We were helpless when it came to handling everything else, but we could damn well make sure that bracelet stayed in his grasp, even when the nurses moved him and it got tangled up in the sheets. Once it went missing for a couple of hours, and my brother interrogated the nurses until it was discovered under Dadâ€™s body.</p><p>My sister now keeps the bracelet in a box at her home. I have my own wearable token: a ring designed by London jeweler <a href="http://www.rachelboston.co.uk/">Rachel Boston</a>. I met Rachel through work â€” basically, I stalked her online, then begged her to model <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/holiday-hair-updos#slide">holiday hairstyles</a> for a Refinery29 article â€” and was a fan of her spiky, slender pieces, many of which are bespoke. A few weeks after my dadâ€™s death, I emailed Rachel to float the idea of commissioning a ring that I could wear in honor of my dad. She responded right away, and we arranged to meet at her studio.</p>     <figure>

<p>My initial thoughts about how the ring might look were vague and filled with doubt. Dadâ€™s initials? Something Celtic to highlight our Irish roots? All I knew was that I needed something to mark his loss. The grief was like a phantom limb, and I needed to hold it; I needed something tangible. In those days, I contemplated tattooing my skin; having a baby just to name it after my dad; building a monument, anything to have something that said â€œhe was here.â€ I chose a ring because it was true to me; Iâ€™ve lost every earring and tangled every necklace Iâ€™ve ever owned, but Iâ€™m always wearing a ring. In a way I was wedding myself to the memory of my father, wrapping his love, and my grief, around me.</p><p>My non-negotiables were few: It had to be gold. It had to be engraved. It had to have some sort of visual representation of me and my siblings â€” this was their loss, too. I suggested a triangle, with each side symbolizing one of us, but left it all up to Rachel. I apologized for my lack of clarity but sensed that sheâ€™d be able to push through them.</p><p>A month later, I was in Boston with my family for a memorial arranged by my aunt at her church. I saw that Rachel had emailed her preliminary designs as I sat listening to my sister rehearse the reading she was scheduled to give at the church that evening. Her job was to thank everyone for coming, offer up prayers for loved ones, and say a few words about our dad. There was one word she kept stumbling on, and thus kept repeating for practice: constancy. As in, Dadâ€™s constancy.</p><p>I scanned Rachelâ€™s email, which featured four design options. They were all striking, incorporating arrows and sleek gold bands. Her description of the third design, however, stopped me in my tracks.</p>     <figure>

     </figure>
<p>â€œThis is my favorite one,â€ she wrote. â€œI looked at Navajo symbols and I based these two rings on the symbol for the sun, which means â€˜constant,â€™ and the broken arrow, which stands for â€˜peace.â€™â€</p><p>Had she used any other word than â€œconstant,â€ the word my sister was still repeating in the background, would I still have felt the â€œthatâ€™s the oneâ€ pang in my heart? I have no idea. But it seemed like a sign, and, like many people mourning a loved one, I was desperate for signs.</p><p>I got the ring in October, the birthday month Dad and I share. Itâ€™s actually two rings, made of 18-carat yellow gold. The black diamond setting hints at my dadâ€™s dark humor and â€œBlack Irishâ€ roots. Inside, in teeny-tiny letters, his name is engraved alongside mine and my siblings'. To me, the three hash marks on the top ring represent each of us, with the whole symbolizing my dad and our family.</p><p>At first I thought Iâ€™d wear the rings separately day to day, then together for dressier nights out. Iâ€™ve surprised myself by keeping them together, because I like the way they fit. I also like when people compliment them, because it gives me a chance to talk a little about who my father was.</p><p>One admirer, however, told me about her interest in Victorian mourning jewelry. Once upon a time, people wore brooches and rings fashioned out of their deceased loved onesâ€™ hair. It was a time when propping up dead bodies for photos wasnâ€™t unheard of, and even the Queen wore mourning black. It seems macabre, but I get it now.</p><p>This week, amid preparations for finalizing Dadâ€™s headstone and marking the first anniversary of his death, my siblings Skyped me to float the idea of each of us getting a tattoo in his honor. Iâ€™m the only one of us without any ink, so the conversation was really about whether or not I was willing to go under the needle when Iâ€™ve spent 37 years avoiding it. I said yes, and so the debate over designs and symbolism begins again. I look forward to it.</p>]]></description>

   <title>How Getting Rid Of This One Item Changed My Life</title>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Something good is happening lately â€” I feel fitter, happier, and in control. My clothes seem to fit better than they used to and I'm more energized and confident. No, it's not the latest fad diet. I haven't changed a thing about my workout routine. Here's the thing: I no longer own a full-length mirror.</p><p>Mirrors weren't always a problem for me. When I was young, I hardly gave my reflection a second thought. I was a skinny kid â€” the little girl with a voracious appetite and endless energy. As a teen, I could eat what I pleased: A cheesy Buffalo chicken calzone, big helpings of my mom's unbeatable spaghetti, sandwiches piled high with cold cuts. Even with college nights of heavy drinking and the late-night eats that went with them, I only gained a few auxiliary pounds. In fact, I loved food so much that I made it my job after graduation when I became an assistant editor at a national food publication in New York City.</p><p>New York. A job. I was an adult. And, just like that, my pizza party was over.</p><p>I started gaining weight â€” fast. Pants ripped unceremoniously. Sweaters grew tight in the shoulders. Cellulite showed up in places I never knew it could (Arms? REALLY?!). My identity as the skinny girl who could hold her own at 25-cent wings night, was shaken. My metabolism had come to a screeching halt; for the first time, I felt the need to watch what I ate. But, the "eat what I want, when I want it" mentality was nearly indelible after a lifetime of being able to do exactly that.</p>     <blockquote>The one thing that ate me alive was seeing my new body in my full-length mirror.</blockquote>
<p>I knew I'd gained weight, but I didn't want to let it change my life. I conducted business as usual: Dinner or drinks with friends five nights a week (with guilt-erasing healthy lunches, and a workout here and there). But the one thing that ate me alive was seeing my new body in my full-length mirror.</p><p>I'd always been an indecisive dresser, but now it was out of control. Mornings began with me ripping through my drawers and closet for multiple outfit changes and painstaking tweaks. If a pair of jeans made my legs look too thick or a shirt didn't fall perfectly, I'd nix them â€” even if, to everyone else, I looked great. The dressing panic became a habit; I was consistently running late for work, missing big chunks of movies, and â€” in one extreme circumstance â€” losing a reservation at a restaurant because I spent so long deliberating over a dress.</p>     <figure>

<p>This anxiety may seem obsessive, but it's not at all unusual. According to research done by the <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/girls/html/home/home.shtml">NYC Girls Project</a>, a municipal group dedicated to raising the self-esteem of young women, a fear of being overweight typically begins <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/girls/html/issues/issues.shtml">at the age of 10</a>. We are taught that a perfect appearance is the end-all-be-all. We're taught to hate our flaws â€” not embrace them.</p><p>It's those voices that chip away at our self-confidence, and despite my skinny youth, they'd finally gotten to me, too. As much as I hate to admit it, whenever I caught my reflection in the mirror in a less-than-glamorous state, it instantly triggered those nasty thoughts â€” especially when I was still adjusting to my curvier body.</p>     <blockquote>We're taught to hate our flaws â€”Â not embrace them.</blockquote>
<p>By the time I left my job at the food magazine, I'd gained 25 pounds. I got a new job as a travel writer, moved from my home in Brooklyn to the healthier, more active town of San Francisco. My full-length mirror did not come with me. It wasn't deliberate; just a question of logistics. I figured I'd pick up a new one when I got there. During that first California run to Target, I focused on all the major necessities: Sheets, towels, toiletries, shelving, a lamp. Afterward, I realized that somehow, a mirror didn't make it onto the shopping list. I shrugged and told myself I'd get one the following week. Winging my outfits for a couple days wouldn't be that bad.</p><p>And, wing it I did. I chose straightforward outfits that looked great spread out on my bed: White jeans and a chambray top, a cropped gray sweater with a black pleated skirt, floral pants and a black slouchy top. I'd put the clothes on in the morning and if the ensemble worked when I looked down at myself, I'd walk out the door with the confidence of a street style star.</p><p>Without even realizing it, I'd broken free from my hyper-critical routine. A couple of mirror-less days turned into weeks â€” and then months. During that time, I started to pick up some new healthy habits that had nothing to do with my weight. I had a new freedom from self-judgment (and I hadn't been late for work in months!). Without the mirror, I felt better.</p><p>Finally, I decided that my room would be a judgment-free zone, without any reflection in which to scrutinize myself. In my transition to a naturally healthier lifestyle, a mirror would only provide a road block; a way of dissecting my appearance and obsessively tracking its change. My chill zone is not the place for bad body-image vibes, especially at my most vulnerable times: Before work or late at night.</p><p>I think of myself as a confident person. I like my body, and I like leading a healthy, fit life. I also love long dinners, cocktails with friends, and the weekend bagel with a generous smear of cream cheese. My body is not perfect, but it's a reflection of my life and I wouldn't change a thing.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.refinery29.com/the-anti-diet-project"></a></strong></p><p><strong><em>Danielle Walsh is an Associate Web Editor at <a href="http://www.afar.com/">AFAR</a>.

   <title>Can All Women Have Multiple Orgasms?</title>

   <description><![CDATA[<p>Ah, the female orgasm: Many women spend a major part of their sexually active lives in the <a href="http://www.refinery29.com/regular-orgasms">pursuit</a> of just one, while others can climax with ease. So, we can't help but wonder, are multiple orgasms (a <a href="https://youtu.be/A7PZAPYOT34">commonly upheld</a> "skill" of the female anatomy) actually attainable for all women?</p><p>Related: <a href="http://pubx.ch/1MtQN9t">Your Step-By-Step Guide To Coregasming</a></p><p><em>Women's Health</em> sought out Vivienne Cass, PhD, author of <em>The Elusive Orgasm</em>, for her expert opinion on the matter. Dr. Cass specified that women can, technically, have between five and seven orgasms in a row â€” but, for some, this just doesn't happen. She went on to explain that discomfort or fatigue are common inhibitors, which makes sense. However, a more surprising factor can be <em>over</em> stimulation.</p><p>Related: <a href="http://pubx.ch/1HwDt4O">How To Find Your Own G-Spot</a></p><p>The clitoris is so sensitive that it can be sent into overdrive (and thus become less-than-responsive) if it's given too much attention. Once a woman's reached her first orgasm, Dr. Cass advises that she or her partner focus elsewhere, either on the vagina or simply on the come-down, before going for a second climax. This is one situation where slow and steady does win the race.</p><p><em>Click through to</em> Women's Health <em>for more on the female orgasm.</em> (<a href="http://pubx.ch/1HwDlCs">Women's Health</a>)</p><p>Related: <a href="http://pubx.ch/1MtQU55">What To Do If You Hate The Way His Semen Tastes</a></p>]]></description>
